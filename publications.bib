	abstract = {The past decade has witnessed significant advances in time series modeling with deep learning. While achieving state-of-the-art results, the best-performing architectures vary highly across applications and domains. Meanwhile, for natural language processing, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has demonstrated impressive performance via training one general-purpose model across various textual datasets. It is intriguing to explore whether GPT-type architectures can be effective for time series, capturing the intrinsic dynamic attributes and leading to significant accuracy improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TEMPO, that can effectively learn time series representations. We focus on utilizing two essential inductive biases of the time series task for pre-trained models: (i) decomposition of the complex interaction between trend, seasonal and residual components; and (ii) introducing the design of prompts to facilitate distribution adaptation in different types of time series. TEMPO expands the capability for dynamically modeling real-world temporal phenomena from data within diverse domains. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TEMPO over state-of-the-art methods on zero shot setting for a number of time series benchmark datasets. This performance gain is observed not only in scenarios involving previously unseen datasets but also in scenarios with multi-modal inputs. This compelling finding highlights TEMPO's potential to constitute a foundational model-building framework.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in building foundation models for texts and video data, there is a surge of interest in foundation models for time series. A family of models have been developed, utilizing a temporal auto-regressive generative Transformer architecture, whose effectiveness has been proven in Large Language Models. While the empirical results are promising, almost all existing time series foundation models have only been tested on well-curated ``benchmark'' datasets very similar to texts. However, real-world time series exhibit unique challenges, such as variable channel sizes across domains, missing values, and varying signal sampling intervals due to the multi-resolution nature of real-world data. Additionally, the uni-directional nature of temporally auto-regressive decoding limits the incorporation of domain knowledge, such as physical laws expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we introduce the Time Diffusion Transformer (TimeDiT), a general foundation model for time series that employs a denoising diffusion paradigm instead of temporal auto-regressive generation. TimeDiT leverages the Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and employs diffusion processes to generate high-quality candidate samples without imposing stringent assumptions on the target distribution via novel masking schemes and a channel alignment strategy. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning-free model editing strategy that allows the seamless integration of external knowledge during the sampling process without updating any model parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on a varity of tasks such as forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeDiT.},

Most of the previous forecasting models aim to capture dynamic characteristics from uni-modal numerical historical data. Although extra knowledge can boost the time series forecasting performance, it is hard to collect such information. In addition, how to fuse the multimodal information is non-trivial. In this paper, we first propose a general principle of collecting the corresponding textual information from different data sources with the help of modern large language models (LLM). Then, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework to utilize both the numerical data and the textual information simultaneously, named GPT4MTS. In practice, we propose a GDELT-based multimodal time series dataset for news impact forecasting, which provides a concise and well-structured version of time series dataset with textual information for further research in communication. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on forecasting tasks with extra-textual information.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, there has been substantial advances in time series models and benchmarks across various individual tasks, such as time series forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. Meanwhile, compositional reasoning in time series is prevalent in real-world applications (e.g., decision-making and compositional question answering) and is in great demand. Unlike simple tasks that primarily focus on predictive accuracy, compositional reasoning emphasizes the synthesis of diverse information from both time series data and various domain knowledge, making it distinct and extremely more challenging. In this paper, we introduce Compositional Time Series Reasoning, a new task of handling intricate multistep reasoning tasks from time series data. Specifically, this new task focuses on various question instances requiring structural and compositional reasoning abilities on time series data, such as decision-making and compositional question answering. As an initial attempt to tackle this novel task, we developed TS-Reasoner, a program-aided approach that utilizes large language model (LLM) to decompose a complex task into steps of programs that leverage existing time series models and numerical subroutines. Unlike existing reasoning work which only calls off-the-shelf modules, TS-Reasoner allows for the creation of custom modules and provides greater flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge as well as user-specified constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive set of experiments. These promising results indicate potential opportunities in the new task of time series reasoning and highlight the need for further research.},

This threat has grown in severity as the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) empowers manipulators to generate highly convincing deceptive content with greater efficiency. Furthermore, the recent strides in chatbots integrated with LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have enabled the creation of human-like interactive social bots, posing a significant challenge to both human users and the social-bot-detection systems of social media platforms.These challenges motivate researchers to develop algorithms to mitigate misinformation and social media manipulations. This tutorial introduces the advanced machine learning researches that are helpful for this goal, including (1) detection of social manipulators, (2) learning causal models of misinformation and social manipulation, and (3) LLM-generated misinformation detection.

	abstract = {Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee. We then present two cases (large integer arithmetic and fact verification) where experimental results aligns with our theoretic analysis.},

However, existing methods mainly focus on detecting such accounts by capturing the coordinated activities within a single platform. As a result, their performances are limited as they can not make use of the information from other platforms. In this work, we propose that capturing cross-platform coordinated activities can bring a significant boost to identifying the accounts operated by misinfromation campaigns. To leverage such information in a practical way, we design a novel Conditional Gaussian-distribution Basis to extract cross-platform correlation from Coordinated Activity Set, which can be easily acquired. Experimental results indicate that our methodology outperform baselines and its own variants that can not leverage cross-platform information.},

	abstract = {Suturing technical skill scores are strong predictors of patient functional recovery following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), but manual assessment of these skills is a time and resource-intensive process. By automating suturing skill scoring through computer vision methods, we can significantly reduce the burden on healthcare professionals and enhance the quality and quantity of educational feedbacks. Although automated skill assessment on simulated virtual reality (VR) environments have been promising, applying vision methods to live (‘real’) surgical videos has been challenging due to: 1) the lack of kinematic data from the da Vinci® surgical system, a key source of information for determining the movement and trajectory of robotic manipulators and suturing needles, and 2) the lack of training data due to the labor-intensive task of segmenting and scoring individual stitches from live videos. To address these challenges, we developed a self-supervised pre-training paradigm whereby sim-to-real generalizable representations are learned without requiring any live kinematic annotations. Our model is based on a masked autoencoder (MAE), termed as LiveMAE. We augment live stitches with VR images during pre-training and require LiveMAE to reconstruct images from both domains while also predicting the corresponding kinematics. This process learns a visual-to-kinematic mapping that seeks to locate the positions and orientations of surgical manipulators and needles, deriving “kinematics” from live videos without requiring supervision. With an additional skill-specific finetuning step, LiveMAE surpasses supervised learning approaches across 6 technical skill assessments, ranging from 0.56–0.84 AUC (0.70–0.91 AUPRC), with particular improvements of 35.78\% in AUC for wrist rotation skills and 8.7\% for needle driving skills. Mean-squared error for test VR kinematics was as low as 0.045 for each element of the instrument poses. Our contributions provide the foundation to deliver personalized feedback to surgeons training in VR and performing live prostatectomy procedures.},

This results in having two versions of the same information: one in real-time but with potentially missing data, and the another, albeit complete, is delayed. Many works have studied how to handle missing data for classification and prediction. However, to the best of our knowledge, they do not consider how to leverage the delayed complete data to assist in learning the representation of real-time available data with missing values. This is despite the fact that the delayed complete data contain all the information (e.g., periodicities and trends). In this paper, we propose a framework to enhance the representation learning of the real-time available data by aligning the representation of past real-time but with missing data to that of past delayed but complete data. We test both a distance metric and contrastive learning to achieve this alignment. We implement our framework on a Transformer-based model and experiment it on three datasets. The efficiency of our solution is evaluated against seven baselines and considering four distinct patterns of missing data. Our experiments show that this proposal has a significant improvement in prediction accuracy (5.21\% on average) over the baselines.},

	abstract = {In electronic trading markets, limit order books (LOBs) provide information about pending buy/sell orders at various price levels for a given security. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using LOB data for resolving downstream machine learning tasks (e.g., forecasting). However, dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) LOB data is challenging since distributional shifts are unlabeled in current publicly available LOB datasets. Therefore, it is critical to build a synthetic LOB dataset with labeled OOD samples serving as a testbed for developing models that generalize well to unseen scenarios. In this work, we utilize a multi-agent market simulator to build a synthetic LOB dataset, named DSLOB, with and without market stress scenarios, which allows for the design of controlled distributional shift benchmarking. Using the proposed synthetic dataset, we provide a holistic analysis on the forecasting performance of three different state-of-the-art forecasting methods. Our results reflect the need for increased researcher efforts to develop algorithms with robustness to distributional shifts in high-frequency time series data.},

In this work, we focus on MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version IV), the largest publicly available healthcare dataset, and conduct comprehensive analyses of dataset representation bias as well as interpretability and prediction fairness of deep learning models for in-hospital mortality prediction. In terms of interpretabilty, we observe that (1) the best performing interpretability method successfully identifies critical features for mortality prediction on various prediction models; (2) demographic features are important for prediction. In terms of fairness, we observe that (1) there exists disparate treatment in prescribing mechanical ventilation among patient groups across ethnicity, gender and age; (2) all of the studied mortality predictors are generally fair while the IMV-LSTM (Interpretable Multi-Variable Long Short-Term Memory) model provides the most accurate and unbiased predictions across all protected groups. We further draw concrete connections between interpretability methods and fairness metrics by showing how feature importance from interpretability methods can be beneficial in quantifying potential disparities in mortality predictors.},

Nevertheless, estimating treatment effects in the longitudinal setting in the presence of hidden confounders remains an extremely challenging problem. Recently, there is a growing body of work attempting to obtain unbiased ITE estimates from time-dynamic observational data by ignoring the possible existence of hidden confounders. Additionally, many existing works handling hidden confounders are not applicable for continuous-time settings. In this paper, we extend the line of work focusing on deconfounding in the dynamic time setting in the presence of hidden confounders. We leverage recent advancements in neural differential equations to build a latent factor model using a stochastic controlled differential equation and Lipschitz constrained convolutional operation in order to continuously incorporate information about ongoing interventions and irregularly sampled observations. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the promise of continuous time methods for estimating treatment effects in the presence of hidden confounders.},

At present, many high-level synthesis tools use typical compiler techniques and infrastructures to translate those high-level languages (such as chisel) into circuit description (such as Verilog). Most of the generated designs lack readability, which makes it difficult to optimize further. On the other hand, the software compilation framework may not make full use of the parallelism and reusability of hardware circuits in time and space, which leads to resource waste and affects the performance of the final design. Based on the utilization of hardware reusability, this paper optimizes the hardware compilation framework of FIRRTL. It considers resource reuse and equivalent transformation of priorities. Experiments on RISC-V chips and commercial EDA tools show that these optimizations can reduce the design area by 9.65\% with slight improvement in performance.},

Consequently, an effective and efficient automatic methodology to estimate the influence of the misinformation on user beliefs and activities is needed. However, existing works on misinformation impact estimation either rely on small-scale psychological experiments or can only discover the correlation between user behaviour and misinformation. To address these issues, in this paper, we build up a causal framework that model the causal effect of misinformation from the perspective of temporal point process. To adapt the large-scale data, we design an efficient yet precise way to estimate the Individual Treatment Effect(ITE) via neural temporal point process and gaussian mixture models. Extensive experiments on synthetic dataset verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our model. We further apply our model on a real-world dataset of social media posts and engagements about COVID-19 vaccines. The experimental results indicate that our model recognized identifiable causal effect of misinformation that hurts people's subjective emotions toward the vaccines.},

	abstract = {Large-scale pre-trained language models have attracted extensive attentions in the research community and shown promising results on various tasks of natural language processing. However, the attention maps, which record the attention scores between tokens in self-attention mechanism, are sometimes ineffective as they are learned implicitly without the guidance of explicit semantic knowledge. Thus, we aim to infuse explicit external knowledge into pre-trained language models to further boost their performance. Existing works of knowledge infusion largely depend on multi-task learning frameworks, which are inefficient and require large-scale re-training when new knowledge is considered. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic solution, KAM-BERT, which directly incorporates knowledge-generated attention maps into the self-attention mechanism. It requires only a few extra parameters and supports efficient fine-tuning once new knowledge is added. KAM-BERT achieves consistent improvements on various academic datasets for natural language understanding. It also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods which conduct knowledge infusion into transformer-based architectures. Moreover, we apply our model to an industry-scale ad relevance application and show its advantages in the real-world scenario.},

	abstract = {Long-term spatio-temporal prediction (LTSTP) over different resolutions plays a crucial role in planning and dispatching smart city applications, such as smart transportation and smart grid. The Transformer, which has demonstrated superiority in capturing long-term dependencies, was recently studied for spatio-temporal prediction. However, it is difficult to leverage it using both multi-resolution knowledge and spatio-temporal dependencies to aid LTSTP. The challenge typically lies in addressing two issues: (1) efficiently fusing information across multiple resolutions that demands elaborate and complicated modifications to the model, and (2) handling the necessary long-term sequence that makes concurrent space and time attentions too costly to be performed. To address these issues, we proposed a multi-resolution recursive spatio-temporal transformer (Mu2ReST). It implements a novel multi-resolution structure with recursive prediction from coarser to finer resolutions. This proposal reveals that an arduous modification of the model is not the only way to leverage multi-resolution knowledge. It further uses a redesigned lightweight space-time attention implementation to concurrently capture spatial and temporal dependencies. Experiment results using open and commercial urban datasets demonstrate that Mu2ReST outperforms existing methods for multi-resolution LTSTP tasks.},

This task is challenging since the behavior of an autonomous agent is not only affected by its own intention, but also by the static environment and surrounding dynamically interacting agents. Previous works focused on utilizing the spatial and temporal information in time domain while not sufficiently taking advantage of the cues in frequency domain. To this end, we propose a Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (SpecTGNN), which can capture inter-agent correlations and temporal dependency simultaneously in frequency domain in addition to time domain. SpecTGNN operates on both an agent graph with dynamic state information and an environment graph with the features extracted from context images in two streams. The model integrates graph Fourier transform, spectral graph convolution and temporal gated convolution to encode history information and forecast future trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a multi-head spatio-temporal attention mechanism to mitigate the effect of error propagation in a long time horizon. We demonstrate the performance of SpecTGNN on two public trajectory prediction benchmark datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy.},

We first present an open sim-ulation platform11https://sites.google.com/view/tr-with-prl/ to model the evolution of two diseases, namely Cancer and Sepsis, and individuals' reactions to the received treatment. Secondly, we systematically examine preference-based RL for treatment recommendation via simulated experiments and observe high utility in the learned policy in terms of high survival rate and low side effects, with inferred rewards highly correlated to treatment goals. We further explore the transferability of inferred reward functions and guidelines for agent design to provide insights in achieving the right trade-off among various human objectives with preference-based RL approaches for treatment recommendation in the real world.},

Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective methodology for coordinated group detection to combat the misinformation on social media. However, existing works suffer from various drawbacks, such as, either limited performance due to extreme reliance on predefined signatures of coordination, or instead an inability to address the natural sparsity of account activities on social media with useful prior domain knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a coordination detection framework incorporating neural temporal point process with prior knowledge such as temporal logic or pre-defined filtering functions. Specifically, when modeling the observed data from social media with neural temporal point process, we jointly learn a Gibbs-like distribution of group assignment based on how consistent an assignment is to (1) the account embedding space and (2) the prior knowledge. To address the challenge that the distribution is hard to be efficiently computed and sampled from, we design a theoretically guaranteed variational inference approach to learn a mean-field approximation for it. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to the SOTA model in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We further apply our model on a COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets dataset. The detection result suggests the presence of suspicious coordinated efforts on spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To automate surgeon skills evaluation using robotic instrument kinematic data. Additionally, to implement an unsupervised mislabeling detection algorithm to identify potentially mislabeled samples that can be removed to improve model performance.
METHODS: Video recordings and instrument kinematic data were derived from suturing exercises completed on the Mimic FlexVR robotic simulator. A structured human consensus-building process was developed to determine Robotic Anastomosis Competency Evaluation technical scores across 3 human graders. A 2-layer long short-term memory-based classification model used instrument kinematic data to automate suturing skills assessment. An unsupervised label analyzer (NoiseRank) was used to identify potential mislabeling of skills data. Performance of the long short-term memory model's technical skill score prediction was measured by best area under the curve over the training runs. NoiseRank outputted a ranked list of rated skills assessments based on likelihood of mislabeling.
RESULTS: 22 surgeons performed 226 suturing attempts, which were broken down into 1,404 individual skill assessment points. Automation of needle entry angle, needle driving, and needle withdrawal technical skill scores performed better (area under the curve 0.698-0.705) than needle positioning (0.532) at baseline using all available data. Potential mislabels were subsequently identified by NoiseRank and removed, improving model performance across all domains (area under the curve 0.551-0.766).
CONCLUSION: Using ground truth labels from human graders and robotic instrument kinematic data, machine learning models have automated assessment of detailed suturing technical skills with good performance. Further, an unsupervised mislabeling detection algorithm projected mislabeled data, allowing for their removal and subsequent improvement of model performance.},

	abstract = {As countries look towards re-opening of economic activities amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring public health has been challenging. While contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics. Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals. While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore, we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.},

In addition, these models assume full observability of disease cases and do not account for under-reporting. We present a mathematical model, namely PolSIRD, which accounts for the under-reporting by introducing an observation mechanism. It also captures the effects of intervention policies on the disease spread parameters by leveraging intervention policy data along with the reported disease cases. Furthermore, we allow our recurrent model to learn the initial hidden state of all compartments end-to-end along with other parameters via gradient-based training. We apply our model to the spread of the recent global outbreak of COVID-19 in the USA, where our model outperforms the methods employed by the CDC in predicting the spread. We also provide counterfactual simulations from our model to analyze the effect of lifting the intervention policies prematurely and our model correctly predicts the second wave of the epidemic.},

	abstract = {Vast amount of data generated from networks of sensors, wearables, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the need for advanced modeling techniques that leverage the spatio-temporal structure of decentralized data due to the need for edge computation and licensing (data access) issues. While federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without requiring direct data sharing and exchange, effectively modeling the complex spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains an open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints on data sharing. To bridge this gap, we propose a federated spatio-temporal model -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly encodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which requires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and remains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics modeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating optimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the edge devices. Experiments on the traffic flow forecasting task show that CNFGNN achieves the best forecasting performance in both transductive and inductive learning settings with no extra computation cost on edge devices, while incurring modest communication cost.},

Existing approaches to detect coordinated accounts either make very strict assumptions about coordinated behaviours, or require part of the malicious accounts in the coordinated group to be revealed in order to detect the rest. To address these drawbacks, we propose a generative model, AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation) which jointly models account activities and hidden group behaviours based on Temporal Point Processes (TPP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to capture inherent characteristics of coordination which is, accounts that coordinate must strongly influence each other's activities, and collectively appear anomalous from normal accounts. To address the challenges of optimizing the proposed model, we provide a bilevel optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee on convergence. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method and training algorithm on real-world social network data collected from Twitter related to coordinated campaigns from Russia's Internet Research Agency targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections, and to identify coordinated campaigns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging the learned model, we find that the average influence between coordinated account pairs is the highest.On COVID-19, we found coordinated group spreading anti-vaccination, anti-masks conspiracies that suggest the pandemic is a hoax and political scam.},

Compared with existing work where time was discretized, DeltaGAN generates continuous visitation time to better capture temporal irregularity in human mobility behaviors. Conditioned on the generated time, DeltaGAN synthesizes realistic trajectories by limiting the range of accessible location candidates. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves consistently better performance than baselines when comparing distribution similarities with real-world GPS trajectories via 6 individual trajectory and geographical metrics. We further validate the utility of DeltaGAN on COVID-19 spread simulation and observe the diffusion process under generated trajectories is consistent with that under real data.},

A closer look reveals that the widely used FaceForensics++ dataset is overwhelmingly composed of Caucasian subjects, with the majority being female Caucasians. Our investigation of the racial distribution of deepfakes reveals that the methods used to create deepfakes as positive training signals tend to produce "irregular" faces - when a person's face is swapped onto another person of a different race or gender. This causes detectors to learn spurious correlations between the foreground faces and fakeness. Moreover, when detectors are trained with the Blended Image (BI) dataset from Face X-Rays, we find that those detectors develop systematic discrimination towards certain racial subgroups, primarily female Asians.},

	abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited. The scarcity of real-world data and the difficulty in reproducing the data distribution hinder directly applying meta-learning techniques. Although the knowledge of governing partial differential equations (PDE) of the data can be helpful for the fast adaptation to few observations, it is mostly infeasible to exactly find the equation for observations in real-world physical systems. In this work, we propose a framework, physics-aware meta-learning with auxiliary tasks whose spatial modules incorporate PDE-independent knowledge and temporal modules utilize the generalized features from the spatial modules to be adapted to the limited data, respectively. The framework is inspired by a local conservation law expressed mathematically as a continuity equation and does not require the exact form of governing equation to model the spatiotemporal observations. The proposed method mitigates the need for a large number of real-world tasks for meta-learning by leveraging spatial information in simulated data to meta-initialize the spatial modules. We apply the proposed framework to both synthetic and real-world spatiotemporal prediction tasks and demonstrate its superior performance with limited observations.},

We analyze real-world Twitter datasets comprising fake and true news cascades, to understand differences in diffusion dynamics and user behaviours with regards to fake and true contents. Based on the analysis, we model the diffusion as a mixture of Independent Cascade models (MIC) with parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\_T, {\textbackslash}theta\_F\$ over the social network graph; and derive unsupervised inference techniques for parameter estimation of the diffusion mixture model from observed, unlabeled cascades. Users influential in the propagation of true and fake contents are identified using the inferred diffusion dynamics. Characteristics of the identified influential users reveal positive correlation between influential users identified for fake news and their relative appearance in fake news cascades. Identified influential users tend to be related to topics of more viral information cascades than less viral ones; and identified fake news influential users have relatively fewer counts of direct followers, compared to the true news influential users. Intervention analysis on nodes and edges demonstrates capacity of the inferred diffusion dynamics in supporting network interventions for mitigation.},

Previous works focused on utilizing the spatial and temporal information in time domain while not sufficiently taking advantage of the cues in frequency domain. To this end, we propose a Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (SpecTGNN), which can capture inter-agent correlations and temporal dependency simultaneously in frequency domain in addition to time domain. SpecTGNN operates on both an agent graph with dynamic state information and an environment graph with the features extracted from context images in two streams. The model integrates graph Fourier transform, spectral graph convolution and temporal gated convolution to encode history information and forecast future trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a multi-head spatio-temporal attention mechanism to mitigate the effect of error propagation in a long time horizon. We demonstrate the performance of SpecTGNN on two public trajectory prediction benchmark datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy.},

We first present an open sim-ulation platform11https://sites.google.com/view/tr-with-prl/ to model the evolution of two diseases, namely Cancer and Sepsis, and individuals' reactions to the received treatment. Secondly, we systematically examine preference-based RL for treatment recommendation via simulated experiments and observe high utility in the learned policy in terms of high survival rate and low side effects, with inferred rewards highly correlated to treatment goals. We further explore the transferability of inferred reward functions and guidelines for agent design to provide insights in achieving the right trade-off among various human objectives with preference-based RL approaches for treatment recommendation in the real world.},

Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective methodology for coordinated group detection to combat the misinformation on social media. However, existing works suffer from various drawbacks, such as, either limited performance due to extreme reliance on predefined signatures of coordination, or instead an inability to address the natural sparsity of account activities on social media with useful prior domain knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a coordination detection framework incorporating neural temporal point process with prior knowledge such as temporal logic or pre-defined filtering functions. Specifically, when modeling the observed data from social media with neural temporal point process, we jointly learn a Gibbs-like distribution of group assignment based on how consistent an assignment is to (1) the account embedding space and (2) the prior knowledge. To address the challenge that the distribution is hard to be efficiently computed and sampled from, we design a theoretically guaranteed variational inference approach to learn a mean-field approximation for it. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to the SOTA model in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We further apply our model on a COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets dataset. The detection result suggests the presence of suspicious coordinated efforts on spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To automate surgeon skills evaluation using robotic instrument kinematic data. Additionally, to implement an unsupervised mislabeling detection algorithm to identify potentially mislabeled samples that can be removed to improve model performance.
METHODS: Video recordings and instrument kinematic data were derived from suturing exercises completed on the Mimic FlexVR robotic simulator. A structured human consensus-building process was developed to determine Robotic Anastomosis Competency Evaluation technical scores across 3 human graders. A 2-layer long short-term memory-based classification model used instrument kinematic data to automate suturing skills assessment. An unsupervised label analyzer (NoiseRank) was used to identify potential mislabeling of skills data. Performance of the long short-term memory model's technical skill score prediction was measured by best area under the curve over the training runs. NoiseRank outputted a ranked list of rated skills assessments based on likelihood of mislabeling.
RESULTS: 22 surgeons performed 226 suturing attempts, which were broken down into 1,404 individual skill assessment points. Automation of needle entry angle, needle driving, and needle withdrawal technical skill scores performed better (area under the curve 0.698-0.705) than needle positioning (0.532) at baseline using all available data. Potential mislabels were subsequently identified by NoiseRank and removed, improving model performance across all domains (area under the curve 0.551-0.766).
CONCLUSION: Using ground truth labels from human graders and robotic instrument kinematic data, machine learning models have automated assessment of detailed suturing technical skills with good performance. Further, an unsupervised mislabeling detection algorithm projected mislabeled data, allowing for their removal and subsequent improvement of model performance.},

While contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics. Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals. While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore, we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.},

In addition, these models assume full observability of disease cases and do not account for under-reporting. We present a mathematical model, namely PolSIRD, which accounts for the under-reporting by introducing an observation mechanism. It also captures the effects of intervention policies on the disease spread parameters by leveraging intervention policy data along with the reported disease cases. Furthermore, we allow our recurrent model to learn the initial hidden state of all compartments end-to-end along with other parameters via gradient-based training. We apply our model to the spread of the recent global outbreak of COVID-19 in the USA, where our model outperforms the methods employed by the CDC in predicting the spread. We also provide counterfactual simulations from our model to analyze the effect of lifting the intervention policies prematurely and our model correctly predicts the second wave of the epidemic.},

	abstract = {Vast amount of data generated from networks of sensors, wearables, and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the need for advanced modeling techniques that leverage the spatio-temporal structure of decentralized data due to the need for edge computation and licensing (data access) issues. While federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without requiring direct data sharing and exchange, effectively modeling the complex spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains an open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints on data sharing. To bridge this gap, we propose a federated spatio-temporal model -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly encodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which requires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and remains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics modeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating optimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the edge devices. Experiments on the traffic flow forecasting task show that CNFGNN achieves the best forecasting performance in both transductive and inductive learning settings with no extra computation cost on edge devices, while incurring modest communication cost.},

Existing approaches to detect coordinated accounts either make very strict assumptions about coordinated behaviours, or require part of the malicious accounts in the coordinated group to be revealed in order to detect the rest. To address these drawbacks, we propose a generative model, AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation) which jointly models account activities and hidden group behaviours based on Temporal Point Processes (TPP) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to capture inherent characteristics of coordination which is, accounts that coordinate must strongly influence each other's activities, and collectively appear anomalous from normal accounts. To address the challenges of optimizing the proposed model, we provide a bilevel optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee on convergence. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method and training algorithm on real-world social network data collected from Twitter related to coordinated campaigns from Russia's Internet Research Agency targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections, and to identify coordinated campaigns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging the learned model, we find that the average influence between coordinated account pairs is the highest.On COVID-19, we found coordinated group spreading anti-vaccination, anti-masks conspiracies that suggest the pandemic is a hoax and political scam.},

Compared with existing work where time was discretized, DeltaGAN generates continuous visitation time to better capture temporal irregularity in human mobility behaviors. Conditioned on the generated time, DeltaGAN synthesizes realistic trajectories by limiting the range of accessible location candidates. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves consistently better performance than baselines when comparing distribution similarities with real-world GPS trajectories via 6 individual trajectory and geographical metrics. We further validate the utility of DeltaGAN on COVID-19 spread simulation and observe the diffusion process under generated trajectories is consistent with that under real data.},

Using facial datasets balanced by race and gender, we examine three popular deepfake detectors and find large disparities in predictive performances across races, with up to 10.7\% difference in error rate between subgroups. A closer look reveals that the widely used FaceForensics++ dataset is overwhelmingly composed of Caucasian subjects, with the majority being female Caucasians. Our investigation of the racial distribution of deepfakes reveals that the methods used to create deepfakes as positive training signals tend to produce "irregular" faces - when a person's face is swapped onto another person of a different race or gender. This causes detectors to learn spurious correlations between the foreground faces and fakeness. Moreover, when detectors are trained with the Blended Image (BI) dataset from Face X-Rays, we find that those detectors develop systematic discrimination towards certain racial subgroups, primarily female Asians.},

	abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of real-world physical systems is critical for spatiotemporal prediction tasks, but challenging when data is limited. The scarcity of real-world data and the difficulty in reproducing the data distribution hinder directly applying meta-learning techniques. Although the knowledge of governing partial differential equations (PDE) of the data can be helpful for the fast adaptation to few observations, it is mostly infeasible to exactly find the equation for observations in real-world physical systems. In this work, we propose a framework, physics-aware meta-learning with auxiliary tasks whose spatial modules incorporate PDE-independent knowledge and temporal modules utilize the generalized features from the spatial modules to be adapted to the limited data, respectively. The framework is inspired by a local conservation law expressed mathematically as a continuity equation and does not require the exact form of governing equation to model the spatiotemporal observations. The proposed method mitigates the need for a large number of real-world tasks for meta-learning by leveraging spatial information in simulated data to meta-initialize the spatial modules. We apply the proposed framework to both synthetic and real-world spatiotemporal prediction tasks and demonstrate its superior performance with limited observations.},

We analyze real-world Twitter datasets comprising fake and true news cascades, to understand differences in diffusion dynamics and user behaviours with regards to fake and true contents. Based on the analysis, we model the diffusion as a mixture of Independent Cascade models (MIC) with parameters \${\textbackslash}theta\_T, {\textbackslash}theta\_F\$ over the social network graph; and derive unsupervised inference techniques for parameter estimation of the diffusion mixture model from observed, unlabeled cascades. Users influential in the propagation of true and fake contents are identified using the inferred diffusion dynamics. Characteristics of the identified influential users reveal positive correlation between influential users identified for fake news and their relative appearance in fake news cascades. Identified influential users tend to be related to topics of more viral information cascades than less viral ones; and identified fake news influential users have relatively fewer counts of direct followers, compared to the true news influential users. Intervention analysis on nodes and edges demonstrates capacity of the inferred diffusion dynamics in supporting network interventions for mitigation.},

To the best of our knowledge, existing models for OD flow prediction cannot tackle all of these three issues simultaneously. We propose Multi-Perspective Graph Convolutional Networks (MPGCN) to capture the complex dependencies. Our proposed model first utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal features for each OD pair and then learns the spatial dependency of origins and destinations by a two-dimensional graph convolutional network. Furthermore, we design a dynamic graph together with two static graphs to capture the complicated spatial dependencies and use an average strategy to obtain the final predicted OD flow. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale and real-world datasets, which not only demonstrate our design philosophy but also validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

In this paper, we propose NoiseRank, for unsupervised label noise reduction using Markov Random Fields (MRF). We construct a dependence model to estimate the posterior probability of an instance being incorrectly labeled given the dataset, and rank instances based on their estimated probabilities. Our method 1) Does not require supervision from ground-truth labels, or priors on label or noise distribution. 2) It is interpretable by design, enabling transparency in label noise removal. 3) It is agnostic to classifier architecture/optimization framework and content modality. These advantages enable wide applicability in real noise settings, unlike prior works constrained by one or more conditions. NoiseRank improves state-of-the-art classification on Food101-N ({\textasciitilde}20\% noise), and is effective on high noise Clothing-1M ({\textasciitilde}40\% noise).},

	abstract = {Low-rank tensor factorization has been widely used for many real world tensor completion problems. While most existing factorization models assume a multilinearity relationship between tensor entries and their corresponding factors, real world tensors tend to have more complex interactions than multilinearity. In many recent works, it is observed that multilinear models perform worse than nonlinear models. We identify one potential reason for this inferior performance: the nonlinearity inside data obfuscates the underlying low-rank structure such that the tensor seems to be a high-rank tensor. Solving this problem requires a model to simultaneously capture the complex interactions and preserve the low-rank structure. In addition, the model should be scalable and robust to missing observations in order to learn from large yet sparse real world tensors. We propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based model, named CoSTCo (Convolutional Sparse Tensor Completion). Our model leverages the expressive power of CNN to model the complex interactions inside tensors and its parameter sharing scheme to preserve the desired low-rank structure. CoSTCo is scalable as it does not involve computation- or memory- heavy tasks such as Kronecker product. We conduct extensive experiments on several real world large sparse tensors and the experimental results show that our model clearly outperforms both linear and nonlinear state-of-the-art tensor completion methods.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosis, treatment and outcome predictionin urologic diseases and evaluate its advantages over traditional models and methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed after PROSPERO registration (CRD42018103701) and in compliance with Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methods. Articles between 1994 and 2018 using the search terms "urology", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning" were included and categorized by the application of AI in urology. Review articles, editorial comments, articles with no full-text access, and nonurologic studies were excluded.
RESULTS: Initial search yielded 231 articles, but after excluding duplicates and following full-text review and examination of article references, only 111 articles were included in the final analysis. AI applications in urology include: utilizing radiomic imaging or ultrasonic echo data to improve or automate cancer detection or outcome prediction, utilizing digitized tissue specimen images to automate detection of cancer on pathology slides, and combining patient clinical data, biomarkers, or gene expression to assist disease diagnosis or outcome prediction. Some studies employed AI to plan brachytherapy and radiation treatments while others used video based or robotic automated performance metrics to objectively evaluate surgical skill. Compared to conventional statistical analysis, 71.8\% of studies concluded that AI is superior in diagnosis and outcome prediction.
CONCLUSION: AI has been widely adopted in urology. Compared to conventional statistics AI approaches are more accurate in prediction and more explorative for analyzing large data cohorts. With an increasing library of patient data accessible to clinicians, AI may help facilitate evidence-based and individualized patient care.},

We present DeepFP, an approximate extension of fictitious play in continuous action spaces. DeepFP represents players’ approximate best responses via generative neural networks which are highly expressive implicit density approximators. It additionally uses a game-model network which approximates the players’ expected payoffs given their actions, and trains the networks end-to-end in a model-based learning regime. Further, DeepFP allows using domain-specific oracles if available and can hence exploit techniques such as mathematical programming to compute best responses for structured games. We demonstrate stable convergence to Nash equilibrium on several classic games and also apply DeepFP to a large forest security domain with a novel defender best response oracle. We show that DeepFP learns strategies robust to adversarial exploitation and scales well with growing number of players’ resources.},

	abstract = {A variety of real-world applications require the modeling and the simulation of dynamical systems, e.g., physics, transportation and climate. With the increase of complexity, it becomes challenging to infer the true interactions solely based on observational data. In this work, we propose the Structure-informed Graph-Autoencoder for Relational inference and simulation (SUGAR) which incorporates various structural prior knowledge. SUGAR takes the form of a variational auto-encoder whose latent variables represent the underlying interactions among objects. It represents various structural prior knowledge as differentiable constraints on the interaction graph, and optimizes them using gradient-based methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show our approach clearly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both interaction recovery and simulation.},

	abstract = {Human driving behavior understanding is a key ingredient for intelligent transportation systems. Either developing self-driving car drives like humans or building V2X systems to improve human driving experience, we need to understand how humans drive and interact with environments. Massive human driving data collected by top ride-sharing platforms and fleet management companies, offers the potential for in-depth understanding of human driving behavior. In this paper, we present DBUS, a real-time driving behavior understanding system which works with front-view videos, GPS/IMU signals collected from daily driving scenarios. Unlike previous work of driving behavior analysis, DBUS focuses on not only the recognition of basic driving actions but also the identification of driver's intentions and attentions. The analysis procedure is designed by mimicking the human intelligence for driving, powered with representation capability of deep neural networks as well as recent advances in visual perception, video temporal segmentation, attention mechanism, etc. Beyond systematic driving behavior analysis, DBUS also supports efficient behavior-based driving scenario search and retrieval, which is essential for practical application when working with large-scale human driving scenario dataset. We perform extensive evaluations of DBUS in term of inference accuracy of intentions, interpretability of inferred driver's attentions, as well as system efficiency. We also provide insightful intuitions as to why and how certain components work based on experience in the development of the system.},

In this survey, we describe the modern-day problem of fake news and, in particular, highlight the technical challenges associated with it. We discuss existing methods and techniques applicable to both identification and mitigation, with a focus on the significant advances in each method and their advantages and limitations. In addition, research has often been limited by the quality of existing datasets and their specific application contexts. To alleviate this problem, we comprehensively compile and summarize characteristic features of available datasets.
