abstract: Text classification, whether by topic or genre, is an important task that
  contributes to text extraction, retrieval, summarization and question answering.
  In this paper we present a new pairwise ensemble approach, which uses pairwise Support
  Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers as base classifiers and “input-dependent latent
  variable” method for model combination. This new approach better captures the characteristics
  of genre classification, including its heterogeneous nature. Our experiments on
  two multi-genre collections and one topic-based classification datasets show that
  the pairwise ensemble method outperforms both boosting, which has been demonstrated
  as a powerful ensemble approach, and Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC), which
  applies pairwise-like classifiers for multiclass classification problems.
