abstract: 'In this paper, we analyze complex gaze tracking data in a collaborative
  task and apply machine learning models to automatically predict skill-level differences
  between participants. Specifically, we present findings that address the two primary
  challenges for this prediction task: (1) extracting meaningful features from the
  gaze information, and (2) casting the prediction task as a machine learning (ML)
  problem. The results show that our approach based on profile hidden Markov models
  are up to 96% accurate and can make the determination as fast as one minute into
  the collaboration, with only 5% of gaze observations registered. We also provide
  a qualitative analysis of gaze patterns that reveal the relative expertise level
  of the paired users in a collaborative learning user study.'
