abstract: Kernel conditional random fields (KCRFs) are introduced as a framework for
  discriminative modeling of graph-structured data. A representer theorem for conditional
  graphical models is given which shows how kernel conditional random fields arise
  from risk minimization procedures defined using Mercer kernels on labeled graphs.
  A procedure for greedily selecting cliques in the dual representation is then proposed,
  which allows sparse representations. By incorporating kernels and implicit feature
  spaces into conditional graphical models, the framework enables semi-supervised
  learning algorithms for structured data through the use of graph kernels. The framework
  and clique selection methods are demonstrated in synthetic data experiments, and
  are also applied to the problem of protein secondary structure prediction.
