abstract: 'Learning temporal causal structures among multiple time series is one of
  the major tasks in mining time series data. Granger causality is one of the most
  popular techniques in uncovering the temporal dependencies among time series; however
  it faces two main challenges: (i) the spurious effect of unobserved time series
  and (ii) the computational challenges in high dimensional settings. In this paper,
  we utilize the confounder path delays to find a subset of time series that via conditioning
  on them we are able to cancel out the spurious confounder effects. After study of
  consistency of different Granger causality techniques, we propose Copula-Granger
  and show that while it is consistent in high dimensions, it can efficiently capture
  non-linearity in the data. Extensive experiments on a synthetic and a social networking
  dataset confirm our theoretical results.'
