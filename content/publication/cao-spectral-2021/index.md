abstract: An effective understanding of the contextual environment and accurate motion
  forecasting of surrounding agents is crucial for the development of autonomous vehicles
  and social mobile robots. This task is challenging since the behavior of an autonomous
  agent is not only affected by its own intention, but also by the static environment
  and surrounding dynamically interacting agents. Previous works focused on utilizing
  the spatial and temporal information in time domain while not sufficiently taking
  advantage of the cues in frequency domain. To this end, we propose a Spectral Temporal
  Graph Neural Network (SpecTGNN), which can capture inter-agent correlations and
  temporal dependency simultaneously in frequency domain in addition to time domain.
  SpecTGNN operates on both an agent graph with dynamic state information and an environment
  graph with the features extracted from context images in two streams. The model
  integrates graph Fourier transform, spectral graph convolution and temporal gated
  convolution to encode history information and forecast future trajectories. Moreover,
  we incorporate a multi-head spatio-temporal attention mechanism to mitigate the
  effect of error propagation in a long time horizon. We demonstrate the performance
  of SpecTGNN on two public trajectory prediction benchmark datasets, which achieves
  state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
