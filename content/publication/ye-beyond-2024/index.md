abstract: In recent decades, there has been substantial advances in time series models
  and benchmarks across various individual tasks, such as time series forecasting,
  classification, and anomaly detection. Meanwhile, compositional reasoning in time
  series is prevalent in real-world applications (e.g., decision-making and compositional
  question answering) and is in great demand. Unlike simple tasks that primarily focus
  on predictive accuracy, compositional reasoning emphasizes the synthesis of diverse
  information from both time series data and various domain knowledge, making it distinct
  and extremely more challenging. In this paper, we introduce Compositional Time Series
  Reasoning, a new task of handling intricate multistep reasoning tasks from time
  series data. Specifically, this new task focuses on various question instances requiring
  structural and compositional reasoning abilities on time series data, such as decision-making
  and compositional question answering. As an initial attempt to tackle this novel
  task, we developed TS-Reasoner, a program-aided approach that utilizes large language
  model (LLM) to decompose a complex task into steps of programs that leverage existing
  time series models and numerical subroutines. Unlike existing reasoning work which
  only calls off-the-shelf modules, TS-Reasoner allows for the creation of custom
  modules and provides greater flexibility to incorporate domain knowledge as well
  as user-specified constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through
  a comprehensive set of experiments. These promising results indicate potential opportunities
  in the new task of time series reasoning and highlight the need for further research.
