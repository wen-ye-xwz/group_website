abstract: Learning temporal causal structures between time series is one of the key
  tools for analyzing time series data. In many real-world applications, we are confronted
  with Irregular Time Series, whose observations are not sampled at equally-spaced
  time stamps. The irregularity in sampling intervals violates the basic assumptions
  behind many models for structure learning. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric
  generalization of the Granger graphical models called Generalized Lasso Granger
  (GLG) to uncover the temporal dependencies from irregular time series. Via theoretical
  analysis and extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore,
  we apply GLG to the application dataset of Î´18O isotope of Oxygen records in Asia
  and achieve promising results to discover the moisture transportation patterns in
  a 800-year period.
