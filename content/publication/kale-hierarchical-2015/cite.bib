 abstract = {We describe a unified active transfer learning framework called Hierarchical Active Transfer Learning (HATL). HATL exploits cluster structure shared between different data domains to perform transfer learning by imputing labels for unlabeled target data and to generate effective label queries during active learning. The resulting framework is flexible enough to perform not only adaptive transfer learning and accelerated active learning but also unsupervised and semi-supervised transfer learning. We derive an intuitive and useful upper bound on HATL's error when used to infer labels for unlabeled target points. We also present results on synthetic data that confirm both intuition and our analysis. Finally, we demonstrate HATL's empirical effectiveness on a benchmark data set for sentiment classification.},
