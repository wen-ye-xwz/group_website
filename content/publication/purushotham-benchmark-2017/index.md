abstract: Deep learning models (aka Deep Neural Networks) have revolutionized many
  fields including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition,
  and is being increasingly used in clinical healthcare applications. However, few
  works exist which have benchmarked the performance of the deep learning models with
  respect to the state-of-the-art machine learning models and prognostic scoring systems
  on publicly available healthcare datasets. In this paper, we present the benchmarking
  results for several clinical prediction tasks such as mortality prediction, length
  of stay prediction, and ICD-9 code group prediction using Deep Learning models,
  ensemble of machine learning models (Super Learner algorithm), SAPS II and SOFA
  scores. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III)
  (v1.4) publicly available dataset, which includes all patients admitted to an ICU
  at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2001 to 2012, for the benchmarking
  tasks. Our results show that deep learning models consistently outperform all the
  other approaches especially when the `raw' clinical time series data is used as
  input features to the models.
