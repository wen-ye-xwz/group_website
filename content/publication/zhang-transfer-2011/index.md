abstract: The increasing volume of information generated on micro-blogging sites such
  as Twitter raises several challenges to traditional text mining techniques. First,
  most texts from those sites are abbreviated due to the constraints of limited characters
  in one post; second, the input usually comes in streams of large-volumes. Therefore,
  it is of significant importance to develop effective and efficient representations
  of abbreviated texts for better filtering and mining. In this paper, we introduce
  a novel transfer learning approach, namely transfer latent semantic learning, that
  utilizes a large number of related tagged documents with rich information from other
  sources (source domain) to help build a robust latent semantic space for the abbreviated
  texts (target domain). This is achieved by simultaneously minimizing the document
  reconstruction error and the classification error of the labeled examples from the
  source domain by building a classifier with hinge loss in the latent semantic space.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying them to the task of classifying
  and tagging abbreviated texts. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and
  real application datasets, including Reuters-21578 and Twitter data, suggest substantial
  improvements using our approach over existing ones.
