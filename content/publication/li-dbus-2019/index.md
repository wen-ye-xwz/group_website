abstract: Human driving behavior understanding is a key ingredient for intelligent
  transportation systems. Either developing self-driving car drives like humans or
  building V2X systems to improve human driving experience, we need to understand
  how humans drive and interact with environments. Massive human driving data collected
  by top ride-sharing platforms and fleet management companies, offers the potential
  for in-depth understanding of human driving behavior. In this paper, we present
  DBUS, a real-time driving behavior understanding system which works with front-view
  videos, GPS/IMU signals collected from daily driving scenarios. Unlike previous
  work of driving behavior analysis, DBUS focuses on not only the recognition of basic
  driving actions but also the identification of driver's intentions and attentions.
  The analysis procedure is designed by mimicking the human intelligence for driving,
  powered with representation capability of deep neural networks as well as recent
  advances in visual perception, video temporal segmentation, attention mechanism,
  etc. Beyond systematic driving behavior analysis, DBUS also supports efficient behavior-based
  driving scenario search and retrieval, which is essential for practical application
  when working with large-scale human driving scenario dataset. We perform extensive
  evaluations of DBUS in term of inference accuracy of intentions, interpretability
  of inferred driver's attentions, as well as system efficiency. We also provide insightful
  intuitions as to why and how certain components work based on experience in the
  development of the system.
