abstract: Regularization plays a critical role in modern statistical research, especially
  in high-dimensional variable selection problems. Existing Bayesian methods usually
  assume independence between variables a priori. In this article, we propose a novel
  Bayesian approach, which explicitly models the dependence structure through a graph
  Laplacian matrix. We also generalize the graph Laplacian to allow both positively
  and negatively correlated variables. A prior distribution for the graph Laplacian
  is then proposed, which allows conjugacy and thereby greatly simplifies the computation.
  We show that the proposed Bayesian model leads to proper posterior distribution.
  Connection is made between our method and some existing regularization methods,
  such as Elastic Net, Lasso, Octagonal Shrinkage and Clustering Algorithm for Regression
  (OSCAR) and Ridge regression. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based
  on parameter augmentation is developed for posterior computation. Finally, we demonstrate
  the method through several simulation studies and an application on a real data
  set involving key performance indicators of electronics companies.
