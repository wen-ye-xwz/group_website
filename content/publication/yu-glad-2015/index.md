abstract: 'Traditional anomaly detection on social media mostly focuses on individual
  point anomalies while anomalous phenomena usually occur in groups. Therefore, it
  is valuable to study the collective behavior of individuals and detect group anomalies.
  Existing group anomaly detection approaches rely on the assumption that the groups
  are known, which can hardly be true in real world social media applications. In
  this article, we take a generative approach by proposing a hierarchical Bayes model:
  Group Latent Anomaly Detection (GLAD) model. GLAD takes both pairwise and point-wise
  data as input, automatically infers the groups and detects group anomalies simultaneously.
  To account for the dynamic properties of the social media data, we further generalize
  GLAD to its dynamic extension d-GLAD. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
  our models on both synthetic and real world datasets. The empirical results demonstrate
  that our approach is effective and robust in discovering latent groups and detecting
  group anomalies.'
