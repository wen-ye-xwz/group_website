abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rise of misinformation campaigns that spread
  specific narratives on social media to manipulate public opinions on different areas,
  such as politics and healthcare. Consequently, an effective and efficient automatic
  methodology to estimate the influence of the misinformation on user beliefs and
  activities is needed. However, existing works on misinformation impact estimation
  either rely on small-scale psychological experiments or can only discover the correlation
  between user behaviour and misinformation. To address these issues, in this paper,
  we build up a causal framework that model the causal effect of misinformation from
  the perspective of temporal point process. To adapt the large-scale data, we design
  an efficient yet precise way to estimate the Individual Treatment Effect(ITE) via
  neural temporal point process and gaussian mixture models. Extensive experiments
  on synthetic dataset verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our model. We further
  apply our model on a real-world dataset of social media posts and engagements about
  COVID-19 vaccines. The experimental results indicate that our model recognized identifiable
  causal effect of misinformation that hurts people's subjective emotions toward the
  vaccines.
