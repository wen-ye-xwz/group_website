abstract: Understanding and modeling behavior of multi-agent systems is a central
  step for artificial intelligence. Here we present a deep generative model which
  captures behavior generating process of multi-agent systems, supports accurate predictions
  and inference, infers how agents interact in a complex system, as well as identifies
  agent groups and interaction types. Built upon advances in deep generative models
  and a novel attention mechanism, our model can learn interactions in highly heterogeneous
  systems with linear complexity in the number of agents. We apply this model to three
  multi-agent systems in different domains and evaluate performance on a diverse set
  of tasks including behavior prediction, interaction analysis and system identification.
  Experimental results demonstrate its ability to model multi-agent systems, yielding
  improved performance over competitive baselines. We also show the model can successfully
  identify agent groups and interaction types in these systems. Our model offers new
  opportunities to predict complex multi-agent behaviors and takes a step forward
  in understanding interactions in multi-agent systems.
