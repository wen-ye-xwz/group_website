abstract: In electronic trading markets, limit order books (LOBs) provide information
  about pending buy/sell orders at various price levels for a given security. Recently,
  there has been a growing interest in using LOB data for resolving downstream machine
  learning tasks (e.g., forecasting). However, dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD)
  LOB data is challenging since distributional shifts are unlabeled in current publicly
  available LOB datasets. Therefore, it is critical to build a synthetic LOB dataset
  with labeled OOD samples serving as a testbed for developing models that generalize
  well to unseen scenarios. In this work, we utilize a multi-agent market simulator
  to build a synthetic LOB dataset, named DSLOB, with and without market stress scenarios,
  which allows for the design of controlled distributional shift benchmarking. Using
  the proposed synthetic dataset, we provide a holistic analysis on the forecasting
  performance of three different state-of-the-art forecasting methods. Our results
  reflect the need for increased researcher efforts to develop algorithms with robustness
  to distributional shifts in high-frequency time series data.
