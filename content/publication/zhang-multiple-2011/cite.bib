 abstract = {Most existing Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms  assume data instances and/or data bags are independently and  identically distributed. But there often exists rich additional  dependency/structure information between instances/bags within many  applications of MIL. Ignoring this structure information limits the  performance of existing MIL algorithms. This paper explores the  research problem as multiple instance learning on structured  data (MILSD) and formulates a novel framework that considers  additional structure information. In particular, an effective and  efficient optimization algorithm has been proposed to solve the  original non-convex optimization problem by using a combination of  Concave-Convex Constraint Programming (CCCP) method and an adapted  Cutting Plane method, which deals with two sets of constraints caused  by learning on  instances within individual bags and learning on  structured data. Our method has the nice convergence property,  with specified precision on each set of constraints. Experimental  results on three different applications, i.e., webpage  classification, market targeting, and protein fold identification,  clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over  state-of-the-art methods.},
