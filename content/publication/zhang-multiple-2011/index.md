abstract: Most existing Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms  assume data instances
  and/or data bags are independently and  identically distributed. But there often
  exists rich additional  dependency/structure information between instances/bags
  within many  applications of MIL. Ignoring this structure information limits the  performance
  of existing MIL algorithms. This paper explores the  research problem as multiple
  instance learning on structured  data (MILSD) and formulates a novel framework that
  considers  additional structure information. In particular, an effective and  efficient
  optimization algorithm has been proposed to solve the  original non-convex optimization
  problem by using a combination of  Concave-Convex Constraint Programming (CCCP)
  method and an adapted  Cutting Plane method, which deals with two sets of constraints
  caused  by learning on  instances within individual bags and learning on  structured
  data. Our method has the nice convergence property,  with specified precision on
  each set of constraints. Experimental  results on three different applications,
  i.e., webpage  classification, market targeting, and protein fold identification,  clearly
  demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over  state-of-the-art methods.
