abstract: Protein fold recognition is a key step towards inferring the tertiary structures
  from amino-acid sequences. Complex folds such as those consisting of interacting
  structural repeats are prevalent in proteins involved in a wide spectrum of biological
  functions. However, extant approaches often perform inadequately due to their inability
  to capture long-range interactions between structural units and to handle low sequence
  similarities across proteins (under 25% identity). In this paper, we propose a chain
  graph model built on a causally connected series of segmentation conditional random
  fields (SCRFs) to address these issues. Specifically, the SCRF model captures long-range
  interactions within recurring structural units and the Bayesian network backbone
  decomposes cross-repeat interactions into locally computable modules consisting
  of repeat-specific SCRFs and a model for sequence motifs. We applied this model
  to predict Î²-helices and leucine-rich repeats, and found it significantly outperforms
  extant methods in predictive accuracy and/or computational efficiency.
