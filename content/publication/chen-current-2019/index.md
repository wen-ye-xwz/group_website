abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To investigate the applications of artificial intelligence (AI)
  in diagnosis, treatment and outcome predictionin urologic diseases and evaluate
  its advantages over traditional models and methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature
  search was performed after PROSPERO registration (CRD42018103701) and in compliance
  with Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
  methods. Articles between 1994 and 2018 using the search terms \"urology\", \"artificial
  intelligence\", \"machine learning\" were included and categorized by the application
  of AI in urology. Review articles, editorial comments, articles with no full-text
  access, and nonurologic studies were excluded. RESULTS: Initial search yielded 231
  articles, but after excluding duplicates and following full-text review and examination
  of article references, only 111 articles were included in the final analysis. AI
  applications in urology include: utilizing radiomic imaging or ultrasonic echo data
  to improve or automate cancer detection or outcome prediction, utilizing digitized
  tissue specimen images to automate detection of cancer on pathology slides, and
  combining patient clinical data, biomarkers, or gene expression to assist disease
  diagnosis or outcome prediction. Some studies employed AI to plan brachytherapy
  and radiation treatments while others used video based or robotic automated performance
  metrics to objectively evaluate surgical skill. Compared to conventional statistical
  analysis, 71.8% of studies concluded that AI is superior in diagnosis and outcome
  prediction. CONCLUSION: AI has been widely adopted in urology. Compared to conventional
  statistics AI approaches are more accurate in prediction and more explorative for
  analyzing large data cohorts. With an increasing library of patient data accessible
  to clinicians, AI may help facilitate evidence-based and individualized patient
  care.'
