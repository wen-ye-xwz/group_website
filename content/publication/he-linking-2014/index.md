abstract: Most existing works on multi-task learning (MTL) assume the same input space
  for different tasks. In this paper, we address a general setting where different
  tasks have heterogeneous input spaces. This setting has a lot of potential applications,
  yet it poses new algorithmic challenges - how can we link seemingly uncorrelated
  tasks to mutually boost their learning performance?Our key observation is that in
  many real applications, there might exist some correspondence among the inputs of
  different tasks, which is referred to as pivots. For such applications, we first
  propose a learning scheme for multiple tasks and analyze its generalization performance.
  Then we focus on the problems where only a limited number of the pivots are available,
  and propose a general framework to leverage the pivot information. The idea is to
  map the heterogeneous input spaces to a common space, and construct a single prediction
  model in this space for all the tasks. We further propose an effective optimization
  algorithm to find both the mappings and the prediction model. Experimental results
  demonstrate its effectiveness, especially with very limited number of pivots.
