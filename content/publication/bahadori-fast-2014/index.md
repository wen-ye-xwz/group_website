abstract: Accurate and efficient analysis of multivariate spatio-temporal data is
  critical in climatology, geology, and sociology applications. Existing models usually
  assume simple inter-dependence among variables, space, and time, and are computationally
  expensive. We propose a unified low rank tensor learning framework for multivariate
  spatio-temporal analysis, which can conveniently incorporate different properties
  in spatio-temporal data, such as spatial clustering and shared structure among variables.
  We demonstrate how the general framework can be applied to cokriging and forecasting
  tasks, and develop an efficient greedy algorithm to solve the resulting optimization
  problem with convergence guarantee. We conduct experiments on both synthetic datasets
  and real application datasets to demonstrate that our method is not only significantly
  faster than existing methods but also achieves lower estimation error.
