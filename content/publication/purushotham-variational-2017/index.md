abstract: We study the problem of learning domain invariant representations for time
  series data while transferring the complex temporal latent dependencies between
  the domains. Our model termed as Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation
  (VRADA) is built atop a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) and trains adversarially
  to capture complex temporal relationships that are domain-invariant. This is (as
  far as we know) the first to capture and transfer temporal latent dependencies in
  multivariate time-series data. Through experiments on real-world multivariate healthcare
  time-series datasets, we empirically demonstrate that learning temporal dependencies
  helps our model's ability to create domain-invariant representations, allowing our
  model to outperform current state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation approaches.
