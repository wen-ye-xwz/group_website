abstract: Determining similarities (or distance) between multivariate time series
  sequences is a fundamental problem in time series analysis. The complex temporal
  dependencies and variable lengths of time series make it an extremely challenging
  task. Most existing work either rely on heuristics which lacks flexibility and theoretical
  justifications, or build complex algorithms that are not scalable to big data. In
  this paper, we propose a novel and effective metric learning model for multivariate
  time series, referred to as Deep ExpeCted Alignment DistancE (DECADE). It yields
  a valid distance metric for time series with unequal lengths by sampling from an
  innovative alignment mechanism, namely expected alignment, and captures complex
  temporal multivariate dependencies in local representation learned by deep networks.
  On the whole, DECADE can provide valid data-dependent distance metric efficiently
  via end-toend gradient training. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and application
  datasets with multivariate time series demonstrate the superior performance of DECADE
  compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
