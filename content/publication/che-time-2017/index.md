abstract: Exponential growth in mobile health devices and electronic health records
  has resulted in a surge of large-scale time series data, which demands effective
  and fast machine learning models for analysis and discovery. In this chapter, we
  discuss a novel framework based on deep learning which automatically performs feature
  learning from heterogeneous time series data. It is well-suited for healthcare applications,
  where available data have many sparse outputs (e.g., rare diagnoses) and exploitable
  structures (e.g., temporal order and relationships between labels). Furthermore,
  we introduce a simple yet effective knowledge-distillation approach to learn an
  interpretable model while achieving the prediction performance of deep models. We
  conduct experiments on several real-world datasets and show the empirical efficacy
  of our framework and the interpretability of the mimic models.
