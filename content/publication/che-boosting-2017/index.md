abstract: The rapid growth of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), as well as the accompanied
  opportunities in Data-Driven Healthcare (DDH), has been attracting widespread interests
  and attentions. Recent progress in the design and applications of deep learning
  methods has shown promising results and is forcing massive changes in healthcare
  academia and industry, but most of these methods rely on massive labeled data. In
  this work, we propose a general deep learning framework which is able to boost risk
  prediction performance with limited EHR data. Our model takes a modified generative
  adversarial network namely ehrGAN, which can provide plausible labeled EHR data
  by mimicking real patient records, to augment the training dataset in a semi-supervised
  learning manner. We use this generative model together with a convolutional neural
  network (CNN) based prediction model to improve the onset prediction performance.
  Experiments on two real healthcare datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework
  produces realistic data samples and achieves significant improvements on classification
  tasks with the generated data over several stat-of-the-art baselines.
