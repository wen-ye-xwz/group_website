abstract: An important challenge in understanding climate change is to uncover the
  dependency relationships between various climate observations and forcing factors.
  Graphical lasso, a recently proposed L1 penalty based structure learning algorithm,
  has been proven successful for learning underlying dependency structures for the
  data drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. However, climatological data
  often turn out to be non-Gaussian, e.g. cloud cover, precipitation, etc. In this
  paper, we examine nonparametric learning methods to address this challenge. In particular,
  we develop a methodology to learn dynamic graph structures from spatial-temporal
  data so that the graph structures at adjacent time or locations are similar. Experimental
  results demonstrate that our method not only recovers the underlying graph well
  but also captures the smooth variation properties on both synthetic data and climate
  data. An important challenge in understanding climate change is to  uncover the
  dependency relationships between various climate observations and forcing factors.
