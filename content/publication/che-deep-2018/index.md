abstract: Opioid analgesics, as commonly prescribed medications used for relieving
  pain in patients, are especially prevalent in US these years. However, an increasing
  amount of opioid misuse and abuse have caused lots of consequences. Researchers
  and clinicians have attempted to discover the factors leading to opioid long-term
  use, dependence, and abuse, but only limited incidents are understood from previous
  works. Motivated by recent successes of deep learning and the abundant amount of
  electronic health records, we apply state-of-the-art deep and recurrent neural network
  models on a dataset of more than one hundred thousand opioid users. Our models are
  shown to achieve robust and superior results on classifying opioid users, and are
  able to extract key factors for different opioid user groups. This work is also
  a good demonstration on adopting novel deep learning methods for real-world health
  care problems.
