abstract: "Recommendation is a prevalent application of machine learning that affects
  many users; therefore, it is important for recommender models to be accurate and
  interpretable. In this work, we propose a method to both interpret and augment the
  predictions of black-box recommender systems. In particular, we propose to interpret
  feature interactions from a source recommender model and explicitly encode these
  interactions in a target recommender model, where both source and target models
  are black-boxes. By not assuming the structure of the recommender system, our approach
  can be used in general settings. In our experiments, we focus on a prominent use
  of machine learning recommendation: ad-click prediction. We found that our interaction
  interpretations are both informative and predictive, e.g., significantly outperforming
  existing recommender models. What's more, the same approach to interpret interactions
  can provide new insights into domains even beyond recommendation, such as text and
  image classification."
