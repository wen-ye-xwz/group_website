abstract: In many applications of time series models, such as climate analysis and
  social media analysis, we are often interested in extreme events, such as heatwave,
  wind gust, and burst of topics. These time series data usually exhibit a heavy-tailed
  distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution. This poses great challenges to
  existing approaches due to the significantly different assumptions on the data distributions
  and the lack of sufficient past data on extreme events. In this paper, we propose
  the Sparse-GEV model, a latent state model based on the theory of extreme value
  modeling to automatically learn sparse temporal dependence and make predictions.
  Our model is theoretically significant because it is among the first models to learn
  sparse temporal dependencies among multivariate extreme value time series. We demonstrate
  the superior performance of our algorithm to the state-of-art methods, including
  Granger causality, copula approach, and transfer entropy, on one synthetic dataset,
  one climate dataset and two Twitter datasets.
