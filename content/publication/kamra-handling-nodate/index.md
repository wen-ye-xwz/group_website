abstract: 'Despite signiﬁcant research in Security Games, limited efforts have been
  made to handle game domains with continuous space. Addressing such limitations,
  in this paper we propose: (i) a continuous space security game model that considers
  inﬁnitesize action spaces for players; (ii) OptGradFP, a novel and general algorithm
  that searches for the optimal defender strategy in a parametrized search space;
  (iii) OptGradFP-NN, a convolutional neural network based implementation of OptGradFP
  for continuous space security games; (iv) experiments and analysis with OptGradFP-NN.
  This is the ﬁrst time that neural networks have been used for security games, and
  it shows the promise of applying deep learning to complex security games which previous
  approaches fail to handle.'
