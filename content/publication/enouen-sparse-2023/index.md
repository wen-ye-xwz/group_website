abstract: There is currently a large gap in performance between the statistically
  rigorous methods like linear regression or additive splines and the powerful deep
  methods using neural networks. Previous works attempting to close this gap have
  failed to fully investigate the exponentially growing number of feature combinations
  which deep networks consider automatically during training. In this work, we develop
  a tractable selection algorithm to efficiently identify the necessary feature combinations
  by leveraging techniques in feature interaction detection. Our proposed Sparse Interaction
  Additive Networks (SIAN) construct a bridge from these simple and interpretable
  models to fully connected neural networks. SIAN achieves competitive performance
  against state-of-the-art methods across multiple large-scale tabular datasets and
  consistently finds an optimal tradeoff between the modeling capacity of neural networks
  and the generalizability of simpler methods.
