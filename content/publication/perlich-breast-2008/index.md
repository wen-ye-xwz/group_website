abstract: We describe the ideas and methodologies that we developed in addressing
  the KDD Cup 2008 on early breast cancer detection, and discuss how they contributed
  to our success. The most important components of our solution were 1) the identification
  of predictive information in the patient identifier, 2) a linear SVM on the 117
  provided features, and 3) a heuristic post-processing approach to optimize the evaluation
  criteria.
