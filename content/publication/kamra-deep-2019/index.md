abstract: Fictitious play has been a classic algorithm to solve two-player adversarial
  games with discrete action spaces. In this work we develop an approximate extension
  of fictitious play to two-player games with high-dimensional continuous action spaces.
  We use generative neural networks to approximate players' best responses while also
  learning a differentiable approximate model to the players' rewards given their
  actions. Both these networks are trained jointly with gradient-based optimization
  to emulate fictitious play. We explore our approach in zero-sum games, non zero-sum
  games and security game domains.
