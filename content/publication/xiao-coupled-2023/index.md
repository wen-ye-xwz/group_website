abstract: Coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) are key tasks in modeling
  the complex dynamics of many physical processes. Recently, neural operators have
  shown the ability to solve PDEs by learning the integral kernel directly in Fourier/Wavelet
  space, so the difficulty for solving the coupled PDEs depends on dealing with the
  coupled mappings between the functions. Towards this end, we propose a textitoÌ§upled
  multiwavelets neural operator (CMWNO) learning scheme by decoupling the coupled
  integral kernels during the multiwavelet decomposition and reconstruction procedures
  in the Wavelet space. The proposed model achieves significantly higher accuracy
  compared to previous learning-based solvers in solving the coupled PDEs including
  Gray-Scott (GS) equations and the non-local mean field game (MFG) problem. According
  to our experimental results, the proposed model exhibits a $2times sim 4times$ improvement
  relative $L$2 error compared to the best results from the state-of-the-art models.
