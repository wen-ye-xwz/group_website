abstract: Learning temporal graph structures from time series data reveals important
  dependency relationships between current observations and histories. Most previous
  work focuses on learning and predicting with \"static\" temporal graphs only. However,
  in many applications such as mechanical systems and biology systems, the temporal
  dependencies might change over time. In this paper, we develop a dynamic temporal
  graphical models based on hidden Markov model regression and lasso-type algorithms.
  Our method is able to integrate two usually separate tasks, i.e. inferring underlying
  states and learning temporal graphs, in one unified model. The output temporal graphs
  provide better understanding about complex systems, i.e. how their dependency graphs
  evolve over time, and achieve more accurate predictions. We examine our model on
  two synthetic datasets as well as a real application dataset for monitoring oil-production
  equipment to capture different stages of the system, and achieve promising results.
