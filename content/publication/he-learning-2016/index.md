abstract: We study the problem of learning influence functions under incomplete observations
  of node activations. Incomplete observations are a major concern as most (online
  and real-world) social networks are not fully observable. We establish both proper
  and improper PAC learnability of influence functions under randomly missing observations.
  Proper PAC learnability under the Discrete-Time Linear Threshold (DLT) and Discrete-Time
  Independent Cascade (DIC) models is established by reducing incomplete observations
  to complete observations in a modified graph. Our improper PAC learnability result
  applies for the DLT and DIC models as well as the Continuous-Time Independent Cascade
  (CIC) model.  It is based on a parametrization in terms of reachability features,
  and also gives rise to an efficient and practical heuristic. Experiments on synthetic
  and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our method to compensate even
  for a fairly large fraction of missing observations.
