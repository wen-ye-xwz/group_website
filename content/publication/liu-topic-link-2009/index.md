abstract: Given a large-scale linked document collection, such as a collection of
  blog posts or a research literature archive, there are two fundamental problems
  that have generated a lot of interest in the research community. One is to identify
  a set of high-level topics covered by the documents in the collection; the other
  is to uncover and analyze the social network of the authors of the documents. So
  far these problems have been viewed as separate problems and considered independently
  from each other. In this paper we argue that these two problems are in fact inter-dependent
  and should be addressed together. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical approach that
  performs topic modeling and author community discovery in one unified framework.
  The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated on two blog data sets in different
  domains and one research paper citation data from CiteSeer.
