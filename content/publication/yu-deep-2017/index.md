abstract: Traffic forecasting is a vital part of intelligent transportation systems.
  It becomes particularly challenging due to short-term (e.g., accidents, constructions)
  and long-term (e.g., peak-hour, seasonal, weather) traffic patterns. While most
  of the previously proposed techniques focus on normal condition forecasting, a single
  framework for extreme condition traffic forecasting does not exist. To address this
  need, we propose to take a deep learning approach. We build a deep neural network
  based on long short term memory (LSTM) units. We apply Deep LSTM to forecast peak-hour
  traffic and manage to identify unique characteristics of the traffic data. We further
  improve the model for post-accident forecasting with Mixture Deep LSTM model. It
  jointly models the normal condition traffic and the pattern of accidents. We evaluate
  our model on a real-world large-scale traffic dataset in Los Angeles. When trained
  end-to-end with suitable regularization, our approach achieves 30%â€“50% improvement
  over baselines. We also demonstrate a novel technique to interpret the model with
  signal stimulation. We note interesting observations from the trained neural network.
