abstract: As part of the PhysioNet / Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2016, this
  work focuses on automatic classification of normal / abnormal phonocardiogram (PCG)
  recording, with the aim of quickly identifying subjects that need further expert
  diagnosis. To improve the robustness of the classifiers by increasing the number
  of training samples, the recordings were windowed into 5 second segments and our
  classifiers were trained to classify these segments. Overall recording classification
  was then generated using a voting scheme from classification results of its segments.
  Our features include spectrograms and Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients. Our best
  submission result during the official phase (evaluated on a random 20% of the hidden
  test set) has a score of 0.813, with 0.735 sensitivity and 0.892 specificity. Two
  more submissions are still being evaluated.
