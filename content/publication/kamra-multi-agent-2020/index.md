abstract: Trajectory prediction for scenes with multiple agents and entities is a
  challenging problem in numerous domains such as traffic prediction, pedestrian tracking
  and path planning. We present a general architecture to address this challenge which
  models the crucial inductive biases of motion, namely, inertia, relative motion,
  intents and interactions. Specifically, we propose a relational model to flexibly
  model interactions between agents in diverse environments. Since it is well-known
  that human decision making is fuzzy by nature, at the core of our model lies a novel
  attention mechanism which models interactions by making continuous-valued (fuzzy)
  decisions and learning the corresponding responses. Our architecture demonstrates
  significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art predictive models in
  diverse domains such as human crowd trajectories, US freeway traffic, NBA sports
  data and physics datasets. We also present ablations and augmentations to understand
  the decision-making process and the source of gains in our model.
