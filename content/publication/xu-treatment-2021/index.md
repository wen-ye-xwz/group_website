abstract: Treatment recommendation is a complex multi-faceted problem with many treatment
  goals considered by clini-cians and patients, e.g., optimizing the survival rate,
  mitigating negative impacts, reducing financial expenses, avoiding over-treatment,
  etc. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have gained popularity
  for treatment recommendation. In this paper, we investigate preference-based reinforcement
  learning approaches for treatment recommendation, where the reward function is itself
  learned based on treatment goals, without requiring either expert demonstrations
  in advance or human involvement during policy learning. We first present an open
  sim-ulation platform11https://sites.google.com/view/tr-with-prl/ to model the evolution
  of two diseases, namely Cancer and Sepsis, and individuals' reactions to the received
  treatment. Secondly, we systematically examine preference-based RL for treatment
  recommendation via simulated experiments and observe high utility in the learned
  policy in terms of high survival rate and low side effects, with inferred rewards
  highly correlated to treatment goals. We further explore the transferability of
  inferred reward functions and guidelines for agent design to provide insights in
  achieving the right trade-off among various human objectives with preference-based
  RL approaches for treatment recommendation in the real world.
