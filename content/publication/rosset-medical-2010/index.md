abstract: 'Two major data mining competitions in 2008 presented challenges in medical
  domains: KDD Cup 2008, which concerned cancer detection from mammography data; and
  Informs Data Mining Challenge 2008, dealing with diagnosis of pneumonia based on
  patient information from hospital files. Our team won both of these competitions,
  and in this paper we share our lessons learned and insights. We emphasize the aspects
  that pertain to the general practice and methodology of medical data mining, rather
  than to the specifics of each modeling competition. We concentrate on three topics:
  information leakage, its effect on competitions and proof-of-concept projects; consideration
  of real-life model performance measures in model construction and evaluation; and
  relational learning approaches to medical data mining tasks.'
