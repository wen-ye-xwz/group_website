abstract: Attribution of climate change to causal factors has been based predominantly
  on simulations using physical climate models, which have inherent limitations in
  describing such a complex and chaotic system. We propose an alternative, data centric,
  approach that relies on actual measurements of climate observations and human and
  natural forcing factors. Specifically, we develop a novel method to infer causality
  from spatial-temporal data, as well as a procedure to incorporate extreme value
  modeling into our method in order to address the attribution of extreme climate
  events, such as heatwaves. Our experimental results on a real world dataset indicate
  that changes in temperature are not solely accounted for by solar radiance, but
  attributed more significantly to CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Combined with extreme
  value modeling, we also show that there has been a significant increase in the intensity
  of extreme temperatures, and that such changes in extreme temperature are also attributable
  to greenhouse gases. These preliminary results suggest that our approach can offer
  a useful alternative to the simulation-based approach to climate modeling and attribution,
  and provide valuable insights from a fresh perspective.
