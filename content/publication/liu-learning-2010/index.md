abstract: Learning temporal causal graph structures from multivariate time-series
  data reveals important dependency relationships between current observations and
  histories, and provides a better understanding of complex systems. In this paper,
  we examine learning tasks where one is presented with multiple multivariate time-series,
  as well as a relational graph among the different time-series. We propose an L1
  regularized hidden Markov random field regression framework to leverage the information
  provided by the relational graph and jointly infer more accurate temporal causal
  structures for all time-series. We test the proposed model on climate modeling and
  cross-species microarray data analysis applications.
