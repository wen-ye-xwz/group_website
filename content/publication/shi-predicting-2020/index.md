abstract: 'Predicting Origin-Destination (OD) flow is a crucial problem for intelligent
  transportation. However, it is extremely challenging because of three reasons: first,
  correlations exist between both origins and destinations; second, the correlations
  are dynamic across the time; at last, there are multiple correlations from different
  aspects. To the best of our knowledge, existing models for OD flow prediction cannot
  tackle all of these three issues simultaneously. We propose Multi-Perspective Graph
  Convolutional Networks (MPGCN) to capture the complex dependencies. Our proposed
  model first utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal features
  for each OD pair and then learns the spatial dependency of origins and destinations
  by a two-dimensional graph convolutional network. Furthermore, we design a dynamic
  graph together with two static graphs to capture the complicated spatial dependencies
  and use an average strategy to obtain the final predicted OD flow. We conduct extensive
  experiments on two large-scale and real-world datasets, which not only demonstrate
  our design philosophy but also validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.'
