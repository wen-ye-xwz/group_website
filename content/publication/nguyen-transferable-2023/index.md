abstract: Ovarian cancer, a potentially life-threatening disease, is often difficult
  to treat. There is a critical need for innovations that can assist in improved therapy
  selection. Although deep learning models are showing promising results, they are
  employed as a \"black-box\" and require enormous amounts of data. Therefore, we
  explore the transferable and interpretable prediction of treatment effectiveness
  for ovarian cancer patients. Unlike existing works focusing on histopathology images,
  we propose a multimodal deep learning framework which takes into account not only
  large histopathology images, but also clinical variables to increase the scope of
  the data. The results demonstrate that the proposed models achieve high prediction
  accuracy and interpretability, and can also be transferred to other cancer datasets
  without significant loss of performance.
