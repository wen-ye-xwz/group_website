 abstract = {Ovarian cancer, a potentially life-threatening disease, is often difficult to treat. There is a critical need for innovations that can assist in improved therapy selection. Although deep learning models are showing promising results, they are employed as a "black-box" and require enormous amounts of data. Therefore, we explore the transferable and interpretable prediction of treatment effectiveness for ovarian cancer patients. Unlike existing works focusing on histopathology images, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework which takes into account not only large histopathology images, but also clinical variables to increase the scope of the data. The results demonstrate that the proposed models achieve high prediction accuracy and interpretability, and can also be transferred to other cancer datasets without significant loss of performance.},
