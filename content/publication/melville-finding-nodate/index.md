abstract: Identifying new customers is a critical task for any salesoriented company.
  Of particular interest are companies that sell to other businesses, for which there
  is a wealth of structured information available through ﬁnancial and ﬁrmographic
  databases. We demonstrate that the content of company web sites can often be an
  even richer source of information in identifying particular business alignments.
  We show how supervised learning can be used to build eﬀective predictive models
  on unstructured web content as well as on structured ﬁrmographic data. We also explore
  methods to leverage the strengths of both sources by combining these data sources.
  Extensive empirical evaluation on a real-world marketing case study show promising
  results of our modeling eﬀorts.
