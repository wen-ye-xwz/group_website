abstract: Time series forecasting is an essential area of machine learning with a
  wide range of real-world applications. Most of the previous forecasting models aim
  to capture dynamic characteristics from uni-modal numerical historical data. Although
  extra knowledge can boost the time series forecasting performance, it is hard to
  collect such information. In addition, how to fuse the multimodal information is
  non-trivial. In this paper, we first propose a general principle of collecting the
  corresponding textual information from different data sources with the help of modern
  large language models (LLM). Then, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework to utilize
  both the numerical data and the textual information simultaneously, named GPT4MTS.
  In practice, we propose a GDELT-based multimodal time series dataset for news impact
  forecasting, which provides a concise and well-structured version of time series
  dataset with textual information for further research in communication. Through
  extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on
  forecasting tasks with extra-textual information.
