abstract: Many genes and biological processes function in similar ways across different
  species. Cross-species gene expression analysis, as a powerful tool to characterize
  the dynamical properties of the cell, has found a number of applications, such as
  identifying a conserved core set of cell cycle genes. However, to the best of our
  knowledge, there is limited effort on developing appropriate techniques to capture
  the causality relations between genes from time-series microarray data across species.
  In this paper, we present hidden Markov random field regression with L(1) penalty
  to uncover the regulatory network structure for different species. The algorithm
  provides a framework for sharing information across species via hidden component
  graphs and is able to incorporate domain knowledge across species easily. We demonstrate
  our method on two synthetic datasets and apply it to discover causal graphs from
  innate immune response data.
