abstract: The proliferation of fake news on social media has opened up new directions
  of research for timely identification and containment of fake news, and mitigation
  of its widespread impact on public opinion. While much of the earlier research was
  focused on identification of fake news based on its contents or by exploiting users'
  engagements with the news on social media, there has been a rising interest in proactive
  intervention strategies to counter the spread of misinformation and its impact on
  society. In this survey, we describe the modern-day problem of fake news and, in
  particular, highlight the technical challenges associated with it. We discuss existing
  methods and techniques applicable to both identification and mitigation, with a
  focus on the significant advances in each method and their advantages and limitations.
  In addition, research has often been limited by the quality of existing datasets
  and their specific application contexts. To alleviate this problem, we comprehensively
  compile and summarize characteristic features of available datasets. Furthermore,
  we outline new directions of research to facilitate future development of effective
  and interdisciplinary solutions.
