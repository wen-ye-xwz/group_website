abstract: We describe our work on extracting attribute and value pairs from textual
  product descriptions. The goal is to augment databases of products by representing
  each product as a set of attribute-value pairs. Such a representation is beneficial
  for tasks where treating the product as a set of attribute-value pairs is more useful
  than as an atomic entity. Examples of such applications include demand forecasting,
  assortment optimization, product recommendations, and assortment comparison across
  retailers and manufacturers. We deal with both implicit and explicit attributes
  and formulate both kinds of extractions as classification problems. Using single-view
  and multi-view semi-supervised learning algorithms, we are able to exploit large
  amounts of unlabeled data present in this domain while reducing the need for initial
  labeled data that is expensive to obtain. We present promising results on apparel
  and sporting goods products and show that our system can accurately extract attribute-value
  pairs from product descriptions. We describe a variety of application that are built
  on top of the results obtained by the attribute extraction system.
