abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting has various applications in neuroscience, climate
  and transportation domain. Traffic forecasting is one canonical example of such
  learning task. The task is challenging due to (1) complex spatial dependency on
  road networks, (2) non-linear temporal dynamics with changing road conditions and
  (3) inherent difficulty of long-term forecasting. To address these challenges, we
  propose to model the traffic flow as a diffusion process on a directed graph and
  introduce Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), a deep learning
  framework for traffic forecasting that incorporates both spatial and temporal dependency
  in the traffic flow. Specifically, DCRNN captures the spatial dependency using bidirectional
  random walks on the graph, and the temporal dependency using the encoder-decoder
  architecture with scheduled sampling. We evaluate the framework on two real-world
  large scale road network traffic datasets and observe consistent improvement of
  12% - 15% over state-of-the-art baselines.
