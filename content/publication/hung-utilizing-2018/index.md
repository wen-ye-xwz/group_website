abstract: "PURPOSE: Surgical performance is critical for clinical outcomes. We present
  a novel machine learning (ML) method of processing automated performance metrics
  (APMs) to evaluate surgical performance and predict clinical outcomes after robot-assisted
  radical prostatectomy (RARP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained three ML algorithms
  utilizing APMs directly from robot system data (training material) and hospital
  length of stay (LOS; training label) (≤2 days and textgreater2 days) from 78 RARP
  cases, and selected the algorithm with the best performance. The selected algorithm
  categorized the cases as \\\"Predicted as expected LOS (pExp-LOS)\\\" and \\\"Predicted
  as extended LOS (pExt-LOS).\\\" We compared postoperative outcomes of the two groups
  (Kruskal-Wallis/Fisher's exact tests). The algorithm then predicted individual clinical
  outcomes, which we compared with actual outcomes (Spearman's correlation/Fisher's
  exact tests). Finally, we identified five most relevant APMs adopted by the algorithm
  during predicting. RESULTS: The \\\"Random Forest-50\\\" (RF-50) algorithm had the
  best performance, reaching 87.2% accuracy in predicting LOS (73 cases as \\\"pExp-LOS\\\
  \" and 5 cases as \\\"pExt-LOS\\\"). The \\\"pExp-LOS\\\" cases outperformed the
  \\\"pExt-LOS\\\" cases in surgery time (3.7 hours vs 4.6 hours, p = 0.007), LOS
  (2 days vs 4 days, p = 0.02), and Foley duration (9 days vs 14 days, p = 0.02).
  Patient outcomes predicted by the algorithm had significant association with the
  \\\"ground truth\\\" in surgery time (p textless 0.001, r = 0.73), LOS (p = 0.05,
  r = 0.52), and Foley duration (p textless 0.001, r = 0.45). The five most relevant
  APMs, adopted by the RF-50 algorithm in predicting, were largely related to camera
  manipulation. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, ours is the first study to show that
  APMs and ML algorithms may help assess surgical RARP performance and predict clinical
  outcomes. With further accrual of clinical data (oncologic and functional data),
  this process will become increasingly relevant and valuable in surgical assessment
  and training."
