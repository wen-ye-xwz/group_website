abstract: Functional data, where samples are random functions, are increasingly common
  and important in a variety of applications, such as health care and traffic analysis.
  They are naturally high dimensional and lie along complex manifolds. These properties
  warrant use of the subspace assumption, but most state-of-the-art subspace learning
  algorithms are limited to linear or other simple settings. To address these challenges,
  we propose a new framework called Functional Subspace Clustering (FSC). FSC assumes
  that functional samples lie in deformed linear subspaces and formulates the subspace
  learning problem as a sparse regression over operators. The resulting problem can
  be efficiently solved via greedy variable selection, given access to a fast deformation
  oracle. We provide theoretical guarantees for FSC and show how it can be applied
  to time series with warped alignments. Experimental results on both synthetic data
  and real clinical time series show that FSC outperforms both standard time series
  clustering and state-of-the-art subspace clustering.
