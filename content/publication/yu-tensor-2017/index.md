abstract: Low-rank tensor regression, a new model class that learns high-order correlation
  from data, has recently received considerable attention. At the same time, Gaussian
  processes (GP) are well-studied machine learning models for structure learning.
  In this paper, we demonstrate interesting connections between the two, especially
  for multi-way data analysis. We show that low-rank tensor regression is essentially
  learning a multi-linear kernel in Gaussian processes, and the low-rank assumption
  translates to the constrained Bayesian inference problem. We prove the oracle inequality
  and derive the average case learning curve for the equivalent GP model. Our finding
  implies that low-rank tensor regression, though empirically successful, is highly
  dependent on the eigenvalues of covariance functions as well as variable correlations.
