abstract: We develop and evaluate an approach to causal modeling based on time series
  data, collectively referred to as \"grouped graphical Granger modeling methods.\"
  Graphical Granger modeling uses graphical modeling techniques on time series data
  and invokes the notion of \"Granger causality\" to make assertions on causality
  among a potentially large number of time series variables through inference on time-lagged
  effects. The present paper proposes a novel enhancement to the graphical Granger
  methodology by developing and applying families of regression methods that are sensitive
  to group information among variables, to leverage the group structure present in
  the lagged temporal variables according to the time series they belong to. Additionally,
  we propose a new family of algorithms we call group boosting, as an improved component
  of grouped graphical Granger modeling over the existing regression methods with
  grouped variable selection in the literature (e.g group Lasso). The introduction
  of group boosting methods is primarily motivated by the need to deal with non-linearity
  in the data. We perform empirical evaluation to confirm the advantage of the grouped
  graphical Granger methods over the standard (non-grouped) methods, as well as that
  specific to the methods based on group boosting. This advantage is also demonstrated
  for the real world application of gene regulatory network discovery from time-course
  microarray data.
