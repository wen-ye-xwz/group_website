abstract: Understanding the diffusion of information in social network and social
  media requires modeling the text diffusion process. In this work, we develop the
  HawkesTopic model (HTM) for analyzing text-based cascades, such as \"retweeting
  a post\" or \"publishing a follow-up blog post\". HTM combines Hawkes processes
  and topic modeling to simultaneously reason about the information diffusion pathways
  and the topics characterizing the observed textual information. We show how to jointly
  infer them with a mean-field variational inference algorithm and validate our approach
  on both synthetic and real-world data sets, including a news media dataset for modeling
  information diffusion, and an ArXiv publication dataset for modeling scientific
  influence. The results show that HTM is significantly more accurate than several
  baselines for both tasks.
