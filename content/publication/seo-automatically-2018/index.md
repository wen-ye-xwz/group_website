abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting has become an increasingly important prediction
  task in machine learning and statistics due to its vast applications, such as climate
  modeling, traffic prediction, video caching predictions, and so on. While numerous
  studies have been conducted, most existing works assume that the data from different
  sources or across different locations are equally reliable. Due to cost, accessibility,
  or other factors, it is inevitable that the data quality could vary, which introduces
  significant biases into the model and leads to unreliable prediction results. The
  problem could be exacerbated in black-box prediction models, such as deep neural
  networks. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that can automatically infer
  data quality levels of different sources through local variations of spatiotemporal
  signals without explicit labels. Furthermore, we integrate the estimate of data
  quality level with graph convolutional networks to exploit their efficient structures.
  We evaluate our proposed method on forecasting temperatures in Los Angeles.
