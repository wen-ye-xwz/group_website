abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Protein secondary structure prediction is an important step
  towards understanding how proteins fold in three dimensions. Recent analysis by
  information theory indicates that the correlation between neighboring secondary
  structures are much stronger than that of neighboring amino acids. In this article,
  we focus on the combination problem for sequences, i.e. combining the scores or
  assignments from single or multiple prediction systems under the constraint of a
  whole sequence, as a target for improvement in protein secondary structure prediction.
  RESULTS: We apply several graphical chain models to solve the combination problem
  and show that they are consistently more effective than the traditional window-based
  methods. In particular, conditional random fields (CRFs) moderately improve the
  predictions for helices and, more importantly, for beta sheets, which are the major
  bottleneck for protein secondary structure prediction.'
