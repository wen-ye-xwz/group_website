abstract: Driving datasets accelerate the development of intelligent driving and related
  computer vision technologies, while substantial and detailed annotations serve as
  fuels and powers to boost the efficacy of such datasets to improve learning-based
  models. We propose D$textasciicircum2$-City, a large-scale comprehensive collection
  of dashcam videos collected by vehicles on DiDi's platform. D$textasciicircum2$-City
  contains more than 10000 video clips which deeply reflect the diversity and complexity
  of real-world traffic scenarios in China. We also provide bounding boxes and tracking
  annotations of 12 classes of objects in all frames of 1000 videos and detection
  annotations on keyframes for the remainder of the videos. Compared with existing
  datasets, D$textasciicircum2$-City features data in varying weather, road, and traffic
  conditions and a huge amount of elaborate detection and tracking annotations. By
  bringing a diverse set of challenging cases to the community, we expect the D$textasciicircum2$-City
  dataset will advance the perception and related areas of intelligent driving.
