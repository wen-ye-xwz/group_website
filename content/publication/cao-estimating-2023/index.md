abstract: Estimating treatment effects plays a crucial role in causal inference, having
  many real-world applications like policy analysis and decision making. Nevertheless,
  estimating treatment effects in the longitudinal setting in the presence of hidden
  confounders remains an extremely challenging problem. Recently, there is a growing
  body of work attempting to obtain unbiased ITE estimates from time-dynamic observational
  data by ignoring the possible existence of hidden confounders. Additionally, many
  existing works handling hidden confounders are not applicable for continuous-time
  settings. In this paper, we extend the line of work focusing on deconfounding in
  the dynamic time setting in the presence of hidden confounders. We leverage recent
  advancements in neural differential equations to build a latent factor model using
  a stochastic controlled differential equation and Lipschitz constrained convolutional
  operation in order to continuously incorporate information about ongoing interventions
  and irregularly sampled observations. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets highlight the promise of continuous time methods for estimating treatment
  effects in the presence of hidden confounders.
