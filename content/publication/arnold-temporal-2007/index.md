abstract: The need for mining causality, beyond mere statistical correlations, for
  real world problems has been recognized widely. Many of these applications naturally
  involve temporal data, which raises the challenge of how best to leverage the temporal
  information for causal modeling. Recently graphical modeling with the concept of
  \"Granger causality\", based on the intuition that a cause helps predict its effects
  in the future, has gained attention in many domains involving time series data analysis.
  With the surge of interest in model selection methodologies for regression, such
  as the Lasso, as practical alternatives to solving structural learning of graphical
  models, the question arises whether and how to combine these two notions into a
  practically viable approach for temporal causal modeling. In this paper, we examine
  a host of related algorithms that, loosely speaking, fall under the category of
  graphical Granger methods, and characterize their relative performance from multiple
  viewpoints. Our experiments show, for instance, that the Lasso algorithm exhibits
  consistent gain over the canonical pairwise graphical Granger method. We also characterize
  conditions under which these variants of graphical Granger methods perform well
  in comparison to other benchmark methods. Finally, we apply these methods to a real
  world data set involving key performance indicators of corporations, and present
  some concrete results.
