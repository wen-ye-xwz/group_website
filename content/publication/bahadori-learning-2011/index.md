abstract: Transductive transfer learning is one special type of transfer learning
  problem, in which abundant labeled examples are available in the source domain and
  only textitunlabeled examples are available in the target domain. It easily finds
  applications in spam filtering, microblogging mining and so on. In this paper, we
  propose a general framework to solve the problem by mapping the input features in
  both the source domain and target domain into a shared latent space and simultaneously
  minimizing the feature reconstruction loss and prediction loss. We develop one specific
  example of the framework, namely latent large-margin transductive transfer learning
  (LATTL) algorithm, and analyze its theoretic bound of classification loss via Rademacher
  complexity. We also provide a unified view of several popular transfer learning
  algorithms under our framework. Experiment results on one synthetic dataset and
  three application datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm
  over the other state-of-the-art ones.
