abstract: 'Despite advances in deep learning, neural networks can only learn multiple
  tasks when trained on them jointly. When tasks arrive sequentially, they lose performance
  on previously learnt tasks. This phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting is a
  fundamental challenge to overcome before neural networks can learn continually from
  incoming data. In this work, we derive inspiration from human memory to develop
  an architecture capable of learning continuously from sequentially incoming tasks,
  while averting catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, our contributions are: (i)
  a dual memory architecture emulating the complementary learning systems (hippocampus
  and the neocortex) in the human brain, (ii) memory consolidation via generative
  replay of past experiences, (iii) demonstrating advantages of generative replay
  and dual memories via experiments, and (iv) improved performance retention on challenging
  tasks even for low capacity models. Our architecture displays many characteristics
  of the mammalian memory and provides insights on the connection between sleep and
  learning.'
