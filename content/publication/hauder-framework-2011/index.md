abstract: Data analytics involves choosing between many different algorithms and experimenting
  with possible combinations of those algorithms. Existing approaches however do not
  support scientists with the laborious tasks of exploring the design space of computational
  experiments. We have developed a framework to assist scientists with data analysis
  tasks in particular machine learning and data mining. It takes advantage of the
  unique capabilities of the Wings workflow system to reason about semantic constraints.
  We show how the framework can rule out invalid workflows and help scientists to
  explore the design space. We demonstrate our system in the domain of text analytics,
  and outline the benefits of our approach.
