abstract: Disinformation campaigns on social media, involving coordinated activities
  from malicious accounts towards manipulating public opinion, have become increasingly
  prevalent. Existing approaches to detect coordinated accounts either make very strict
  assumptions about coordinated behaviours, or require part of the malicious accounts
  in the coordinated group to be revealed in order to detect the rest. To address
  these drawbacks, we propose a generative model, AMDN-HAGE (Attentive Mixture Density
  Network with Hidden Account Group Estimation) which jointly models account activities
  and hidden group behaviours based on Temporal Point Processes (TPP) and Gaussian
  Mixture Model (GMM), to capture inherent characteristics of coordination which is,
  accounts that coordinate must strongly influence each other's activities, and collectively
  appear anomalous from normal accounts. To address the challenges of optimizing the
  proposed model, we provide a bilevel optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee
  on convergence. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method and training
  algorithm on real-world social network data collected from Twitter related to coordinated
  campaigns from Russia's Internet Research Agency targeting the 2016 U.S. Presidential
  Elections, and to identify coordinated campaigns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Leveraging the learned model, we find that the average influence between coordinated
  account pairs is the highest.On COVID-19, we found coordinated group spreading anti-vaccination,
  anti-masks conspiracies that suggest the pandemic is a hoax and political scam.
