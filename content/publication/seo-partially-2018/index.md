abstract: More than 1 million homicides, robberies, and aggravated assaults occur
  in the United States each year. These crimes are often further classified into different
  types based on the circumstances surrounding the crime (e.g., domestic violence,
  gang-related). Despite recent technological advances in AI and machine learning,
  these additional classification tasks are still done manually by specially trained
  police officers. In this paper, we provide the first attempt to develop a more automatic
  system for classifying crimes. In particular, we study the question of classifying
  whether a given violent crime is gang-related. We introduce a novel Partially Generative
  Neural Networks (PGNN) that is able to accurately classify gang-related crimes both
  when full information is available and when there is only partial information. Our
  PGNN is the first generative-classification model that enables to work when some
  features of the test examples are missing. Using a crime event dataset from Los
  Angeles covering 2014-2016, we experimentally show that our PGNN outperforms all
  other typically used classifiers for the problem of classifying gang-related violent
  crimes.
