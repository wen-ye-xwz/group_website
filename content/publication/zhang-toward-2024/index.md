abstract: The pervasive abuse of misinformation to influence public opinion on social
  media has become increasingly evident in various domains, encompassing politics,
  as seen in presidential elections, and healthcare, most notably during the recent
  COVID-19 pandemic. This threat has grown in severity as the development of Large
  Language Models (LLMs) empowers manipulators to generate highly convincing deceptive
  content with greater efficiency. Furthermore, the recent strides in chatbots integrated
  with LLMs, such as ChatGPT, have enabled the creation of human-like interactive
  social bots, posing a significant challenge to both human users and the social-bot-detection
  systems of social media platforms.These challenges motivate researchers to develop
  algorithms to mitigate misinformation and social media manipulations. This tutorial
  introduces the advanced machine learning researches that are helpful for this goal,
  including (1) detection of social manipulators, (2) learning causal models of misinformation
  and social manipulation, and (3) LLM-generated misinformation detection. In addition,
  we also present possible future directions.
