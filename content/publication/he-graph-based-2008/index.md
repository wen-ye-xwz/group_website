abstract: Rare category detection is the task of identifying examples from rare classes
  in an unlabeled data set. It is an open challenge in machine learning and plays
  key roles in real applications such as financial fraud detection, network intrusion
  detection, astronomy, spam image detection, etc. In this paper, we develop a new
  graph-based method for rare category detection named GRADE. It makes use of the
  global similarity matrix motivated by the manifold ranking algorithm, which results
  in more compact clusters for the minority classes; by selecting examples from the
  regions where probability density changes the most, it relaxes the assumption that
  the majority classes and the minority classes are separable. Furthermore, when detailed
  information about the data set is not available, we develop a modified version of
  GRADE named GRADE-LI, which only needs an upper bound on the proportion of each
  minority class as input. Besides working with data with structured features, both
  GRADE and GRADE-LI can also work with graph data, which can not be handled by existing
  rare category detection methods. Experimental results on both synthetic and real
  data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the GRADE and GRADE-LI algorithms.
