abstract: One crucial task in intelligent transportation systems is estimating the
  duration of a potential trip given the origin location, destination location as
  well as the departure time. Most existing approaches for travel time estimation
  assume that the route of the trip is given, which does not hold in real-world applications
  since the route can be dynamically changed due to traffic conditions, user preferences,
  etc. As inferring the path from the origin and the destination can be time-consuming
  and nevertheless error-prone, it is desirable to perform origin-destination travel
  time estimation, which aims to predict the travel time without online route information.
  This problem is challenging mainly due to its limited amount of information available
  and the complicated spatiotemporal dependency. In this paper, we propose a MUlti-task
  Representation learning model for Arrival Time estimation (MURAT). This model produces
  meaningful representation that preserves various trip properties in the real-world
  and at the same time leverages the underlying road network and the spatiotemporal
  prior knowledge. Further-more, we propose a multi-task learning framework to utilize
  the path information of historical trips during the training phase which boosts
  the performance. Experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets show
  that the proposed approach achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods
