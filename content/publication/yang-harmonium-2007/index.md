abstract: Accurate and efficient video classification demands the fusion of multimodal
  information and the use of intermediate representations. Combining the two ideas
  into the one framework, we propose a probabilistic approach for video classification
  using intermediate semantic representations derived from multi-modal features. Based
  on a class of bipartite undirected graphical models named harmonium, our approach
  represents the video data as latent semantic topics derived by jointly modeling
  the transcript keywords and color-histogram features, and performs classification
  using these latent topics under a unified framework. We show satisfactory classification
  performance of our approach on a benchmark dataset as well as interesting insights
  into the data.
