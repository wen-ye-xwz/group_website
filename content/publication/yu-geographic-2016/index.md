abstract: Discovering latent structures in spatial data is of critical importance
  to understanding the user behavior of location-based services. In this paper, we
  study the problem of geographic segmentation of spatial data, which involves dividing
  a collection of observations into distinct geo-spatial regions and uncovering abstract
  correlation structures in the data. We introduce a novel, Latent Poisson Factor
  (LPF) model to describe spatial count data. The model describes the spatial counts
  as a Poisson distribution with a mean that factors over a joint item-location latent
  space. The latent factors are constrained with weak labels to help uncover interesting
  spatial dependencies. We study the LPF model on a mobile app usage data set and
  a news article readership data set. We empirically demonstrate its effectiveness
  on a variety of prediction tasks on these two data sets.
