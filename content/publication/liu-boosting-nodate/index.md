abstract: 'This paper studies the eﬀects of boosting in the context of diﬀerent classiﬁcation
  methods for text categorization, including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support
  Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Rocchio-style classiﬁer. We identify the inductive
  biases of each classiﬁer and explore how boosting, as an error-driven resampling
  mechanism, reacts to those biases. Our experiments on the Reuters-21578 benchmark
  show that boosting is not eﬀective in improving the performance of the base classiﬁers
  on common categories. However, the eﬀect of boosting for rare categories varies
  across classiﬁers: for SVMs and Decision Trees, we achieved a 1317% performance
  improvement in macro-averaged F1 measure, but did not obtain substantial improvement
  for the other two classiﬁers. This interesting ﬁnding of boosting on rare categories
  has not been reported before.'
