 abstract = {This paper studies the eﬀects of boosting in the context of diﬀerent classiﬁcation methods for text categorization, including Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and a Rocchio-style classiﬁer. We identify the inductive biases of each classiﬁer and explore how boosting, as an error-driven resampling mechanism, reacts to those biases. Our experiments on the Reuters-21578 benchmark show that boosting is not eﬀective in improving the performance of the base classiﬁers on common categories. However, the eﬀect of boosting for rare categories varies across classiﬁers: for SVMs and Decision Trees, we achieved a 1317% performance improvement in macro-averaged F1 measure, but did not obtain substantial improvement for the other two classiﬁers. This interesting ﬁnding of boosting on rare categories has not been reported before.},
