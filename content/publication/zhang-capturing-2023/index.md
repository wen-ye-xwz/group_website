abstract: Recent years have witnessed the increasing abuse of coordinated accounts
  on multiple social media platforms. Such accounts are usually operated by misinformation
  campaigns to manipulate the public opinions on different platforms jointly. However,
  existing methods mainly focus on detecting such accounts by capturing the coordinated
  activities within a single platform. As a result, their performances are limited
  as they can not make use of the information from other platforms. In this work,
  we propose that capturing cross-platform coordinated activities can bring a significant
  boost to identifying the accounts operated by misinfromation campaigns. To leverage
  such information in a practical way, we design a novel Conditional Gaussian-distribution
  Basis to extract cross-platform correlation from Coordinated Activity Set, which
  can be easily acquired. Experimental results indicate that our methodology outperform
  baselines and its own variants that can not leverage cross-platform information.
