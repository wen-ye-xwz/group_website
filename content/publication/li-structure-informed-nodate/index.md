abstract: A variety of real-world applications require the modeling and the simulation
  of dynamical systems, e.g., physics, transportation and climate. With the increase
  of complexity, it becomes challenging to infer the true interactions solely based
  on observational data. In this work, we propose the Structure-informed Graph-Autoencoder
  for Relational inference and simulation (SUGAR) which incorporates various structural
  prior knowledge. SUGAR takes the form of a variational auto-encoder whose latent
  variables represent the underlying interactions among objects. It represents various
  structural prior knowledge as differentiable constraints on the interaction graph,
  and optimizes them using gradient-based methods. Experimental results on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets show our approach clearly outperforms other state-of-the-art
  methods in terms of both interaction recovery and simulation.
