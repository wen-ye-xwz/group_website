abstract: It is common nowadays for e-commerce websites to encourage their users to
  rate shopping items and write review text. This review text information has been
  proven to be very useful in understanding user preferences and item properties,
  and thus enhances the capability of these websites to make personalized recommendations.
  In this paper, we propose to model user preferences and item properties using a
  convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention, motivated by the huge success
  of CNN for many natural language processing tasks. By using aggregated review text
  from users and items, we aim to build vector representations of user and item using
  attention-based CNNs. These vector representations are then used to predict rating
  values for a user on an item. We train these user and item networks jointly, which
  enables the interaction between users and items in a way similar to the matrix factorization
  technique. In addition, the visualization of the attention layer gives us insight
  on when words are selected by the models that highlight a user’s preferences or
  an item’s properties. We validate the proposed models on popular review datasets,
  Yelp and Amazon, and compare results with matrix factorization (MF), and hidden
  factor and topical (HFT) models. Our experiments show improvement over HFT, which
  proves the eﬀectiveness of these representations learned from our networks on review
  text for rating prediction.
