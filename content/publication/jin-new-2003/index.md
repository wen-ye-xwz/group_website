abstract: AdaBoost has proved to be an effective method to improve the performance
  of base classifiers both theoretically and empirically. However, previous studies
  have shown that AdaBoost might suffer from the overfitting problem, especially for
  noisy data. In addition, most current work on boosting assumes that the combination
  weights are fixed constants and therefore does not take particular input patterns
  into consideration. In this paper, we present a new boosting algorithm, “WeightBoost”,
  which tries to solve these two problems by introducing an input-dependent regularization
  factor to the combination weight. Similarly to AdaBoost, we derive a learning procedure
  for WeightBoost, which is guaranteed to minimize training errors. Empirical studies
  on eight different UCI data sets and one text categorization data set show that
  WeightBoost almost always achieves a considerably better classification accuracy
  than AdaBoost. Furthermore, experiments on data with artificially controlled noise
  indicate that the WeightBoost is more robust to noise than AdaBoost.
