abstract: With rapid growth of commercial search engines, detecting multilingual and
  multi-regional intent underlying search queries becomes a critical challenge to
  serve international users with diverse language and region requirements. We introduce
  a query intent probabilistic model, whose input is the number of clicks on documents
  from different regions and in different language, while the output of this model
  is a smoothed probabilistic distribution of multilingual and multi-regional query
  intent. Based on an editorial test to evaluate the accuracy of the intent classifier,
  our probabilistic model could improve the accuracy of multilingual intent detection
  for 15%, and improve multi-regional intent detection for 18%. To improve web search
  quality, we propose a set of new ranking features to combine multilingual and multi-regional
  query intent with document language/region attributes, and apply different approaches
  in integrating intent information to directly affect ranking. The experiments show
  that the novel features could provide 2.31% NDCG@1 improvement and 1.81% NDCG@5
  improvement.
