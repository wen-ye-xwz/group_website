abstract: Recent pandemic events have greatly emphasized the need to understand how
  humans navigate in modern day cities for effective public health policy implementation.
  In this paper, we propose a two-stage generative model, DeltaGAN, to simulate realistic
  human mobility trajectories. Compared with existing work where time was discretized,
  DeltaGAN generates continuous visitation time to better capture temporal irregularity
  in human mobility behaviors. Conditioned on the generated time, DeltaGAN synthesizes
  realistic trajectories by limiting the range of accessible location candidates.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves consistently better performance
  than baselines when comparing distribution similarities with real-world GPS trajectories
  via 6 individual trajectory and geographical metrics. We further validate the utility
  of DeltaGAN on COVID-19 spread simulation and observe the diffusion process under
  generated trajectories is consistent with that under real data.
