abstract: The number of patents filed each year has increased dramatically in recent
  years, raising concerns that patents of questionable validity are restricting the
  issuance of truly innovative patents. For this reason, there is a strong demand
  to develop an objective model to quantify patent quality and characterize the attributes
  that lead to higher-quality patents. In this paper, we develop a latent graphical
  model to infer patent quality from related measurements. In addition, we extract
  advanced lexical features via natural language processing techniques to capture
  the quality measures such as clarity of claims, originality, and importance of cited
  prior art. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by validating its predictions
  with previous court decisions of litigated patents.
