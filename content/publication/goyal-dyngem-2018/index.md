abstract: 'Embedding large graphs in low dimensional spaces has recently attracted
  significant interest due to its wide applications such as graph visualization, link
  prediction and node classification. Existing methods focus on computing the embedding
  for static graphs. However, many graphs in practical applications are dynamic and
  evolve constantly over time. Naively applying existing embedding algorithms to each
  snapshot of dynamic graphs independently usually leads to unsatisfactory performance
  in terms of stability, flexibility and efficiency. In this work, we present an efficient
  algorithm DynGEM based on recent advances in deep autoencoders for graph embeddings,
  to address this problem. The major advantages of DynGEM include: (1) the embedding
  is stable over time, (2) it can handle growing dynamic graphs, and (3) it has better
  running time than using static embedding methods on each snapshot of a dynamic graph.
  We test DynGEM on a variety of tasks including graph visualization, graph reconstruction,
  link prediction and anomaly detection (on both synthetic and real datasets). Experimental
  results demonstrate the superior stability and scalability of our approach.'
