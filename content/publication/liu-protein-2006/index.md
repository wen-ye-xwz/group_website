abstract: Protein fold recognition is an important step towards understanding protein
  three-dimensional structures and their functions. A conditional graphical model,
  i.e., segmentation conditional random ﬁelds (SCRFs), is proposed as an effective
  solution to this problem. In contrast to traditional graphical models, such as the
  hidden Markov model (HMM), SCRFs follow a discriminative approach. Therefore, it
  is ﬂexible to include any features in the model, such as overlapping or long-range
  interaction features over the whole sequence. The model also employs a convex optimization
  function, which results in globally optimal solutions to the model parameters. On
  the other hand, the segmentation setting in SCRFs makes their graphical structures
  intuitively similar to the protein 3-D structures and more importantly provides
  a framework to model the long-range interactions between secondary structures directly.
  Our model is applied to predict the parallel β-helix fold, an important fold in
  bacterial pathogenesis and carbohydrate binding/cleavage. The cross-family validation
  shows that SCRFs not only can score all known β-helices higher than non-β-helices
  in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but also accurately locates rungs in known beta-helix
  proteins. Our method outperforms BetaWrap, a state-of-the-art algorithm for predicting
  beta-helix folds, and HMMER, a general motif detection algorithm based on HMM, and
  has the additional advantage of general application to other protein folds. Applying
  our prediction model to the Uniprot Database, we identify previously unknown potential
  β-helices.
