abstract: 'KDD Cup 2007 focuses on movie rating behaviors. The goal of the task \"Who
  Rated What\" is to predict whether \"existing\" users will review \"existing\" movies
  in the future. We cast the task as a link prediction problem and address it via
  a simple classification approach. Compared with other applications for link prediction,
  there are two major challenges in our task: (1) the huge size of the Netflix data;
  (2) the prediction target is complicated by many factors, such as a general decrease
  of interest in old movies and more tendency to review more movies by Netflix users
  due to the success of the internet DVD rental industries. We address the first challenge
  by \"selective\" subsampling and the second by combining information from the review
  scores, movie contents and graph topology effectively.'
