abstract: Finding Nash equilibrium in continuous action spaces is a challenging problem
  and has applications in domains such as protecting geographic areas from potential
  attackers. We present DeepFP, an approximate extension of fictitious play in continuous
  action spaces. DeepFP represents players’ approximate best responses via generative
  neural networks which are highly expressive implicit density approximators. It additionally
  uses a game-model network which approximates the players’ expected payoffs given
  their actions, and trains the networks end-to-end in a model-based learning regime.
  Further, DeepFP allows using domain-specific oracles if available and can hence
  exploit techniques such as mathematical programming to compute best responses for
  structured games. We demonstrate stable convergence to Nash equilibrium on several
  classic games and also apply DeepFP to a large forest security domain with a novel
  defender best response oracle. We show that DeepFP learns strategies robust to adversarial
  exploitation and scales well with growing number of players’ resources.
