abstract: The importance of learning from spatiotemporal data has been growing with
  the increasing number of data sources distributed over space. While numerous studies
  have been done for analyzing the spatiotemporal signals, existing models have assumed
  that the heterogeneous data sources in spatial domain are equally reliable over
  time. In this paper, we propose the novel method that infers the time-varying data
  quality level based on the local variations of spatiotemporal signals without explicitly
  assigned labels. Furthermore, we extend the formulation of the quality level by
  combining with graph convolutional networks to exploit the efÔ¨Åcient architecture.
  Finally, we evaluate the proposed method by simulating a forecasting task with real-world
  climate data.
