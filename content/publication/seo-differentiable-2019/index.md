abstract: While physics conveys knowledge of nature built from an interplay between
  observations and theory, it has been considered less importantly in deep neural
  networks. Especially, there are few works leveraging physics behaviors when the
  knowledge is given less explicitly. In this work, we propose a novel architecture
  called Differentiable Physics-informed Graph Networks (DPGN) to incorporate implicit
  physics knowledge which is given from domain experts by informing it in latent space.
  Using the concept of DPGN, we demonstrate that climate prediction tasks are significantly
  improved. Besides the experiment results, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed
  module and provide further applications of DPGN, such as inductive learning and
  multistep predictions.
