abstract: Interpreting neural networks is a crucial and challenging task in machine
  learning. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for detecting statistical
  interactions captured by a feedforward multilayer neural network by directly interpreting
  its learned weights. Depending on the desired interactions, our method can achieve
  significantly better or similar interaction detection performance compared to the
  state-of-the-art without searching an exponential solution space of possible interactions.
  We obtain this accuracy and efficiency by observing that interactions between input
  features are created by the non-additive effect of nonlinear activation functions,
  and that interacting paths are encoded in weight matrices. We demonstrate the performance
  of our method and the importance of discovered interactions via experimental results
  on both synthetic datasets and real-world application datasets.
