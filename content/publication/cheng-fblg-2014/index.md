abstract: Discovering temporal dependence structure from multivariate time series
  has established its importance in many applications. We observe that when we look
  in reversed order of time, the temporal dependence structure of the time series
  is usually preserved after switching the roles of cause and effect. Inspired by
  this observation, we create a new time series by reversing the time stamps of original
  time series and combine both time series to improve the performance of temporal
  dependence recovery. We also provide theoretical justification for the proposed
  algorithm for several existing time series models. We test our approach on both
  synthetic and real world datasets. The experimental results confirm that this surprisingly
  simple approach is indeed effective under various circumstances.
