abstract: 'Resource allocation for coverage of geographical spaces is a challenging
  problem in robotics, sensor networks and security domains. Conventional solution
  approaches either: (a) rely on exploiting spatio-temporal structure of specific
  coverage problems, or (b) use genetic algorithms when targeting general coverage
  problems where no special exploitable structure exists. In this work, we propose
  the coverage gradient theorem, which provides a gradient estimator for a broad class
  of spatial coverage objectives using a combination of Newton-Leibniz theorem and
  implicit boundary differentiation. We also propose a tractable framework to approximate
  the coverage objectives and their gradients using spatial discretization and empirically
  demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on multi-resource spatial coverage problems.'
