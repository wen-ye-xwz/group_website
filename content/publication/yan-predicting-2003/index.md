abstract: Scene classification is an important technique to infer high-level semantic
  scene categories from low-level visual features. However, in the real world the
  positive data for many scenes may be rare, which degrades the performance of many
  classifiers. In this paper, we propose SVM ensembles to address the rare class problem.
  Various classifier combination strategies are investigated, including majority voting,
  sum rule, neural network gater and hierarchical SVMs. We also compare our method
  with two other common approaches for dealing with the rare class problem. Our experimental
  results show that hierarchical SVMs can achieve significantly better and more stable
  performance than other strategies, as well as high computational efficiency.
